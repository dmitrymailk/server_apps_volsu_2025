1. Food and fossil fuel production causing $5bn of environmental damage an hour’
UN GEO report says ending this harm key to global transformation required ‘before collapse becomes inevitable
The unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.
Ending this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.
The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.
“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.
All the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.
“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.
“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.
The experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”
The GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.
A statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”
The GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.
The report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”
One of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.
These costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”
The report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.
There were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.
The climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Removing fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.
 This article was amended on 9 December 2025. An earlier version said that the GEO report estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth “$100bn” by 2100; this should have been $100tn.


2. 2025 ‘virtually certain’ to be second- or third-hottest year on record, EU data shows
Copernicus deputy director says three-year average for 2023 to 2025 on track to exceed 1.5C of heating for first time
This year is “virtually certain” to end as the second- or third-hottest year on record, EU scientists have found, as climate breakdown continues to push the planet away from the stable conditions in which humanity evolved.
Global temperatures from January to November were on average 1.48C higher than preindustrial levels, according to the Copernicus, the EU’s earth observation programme. It found the anomalies were so far identical to those recorded in 2023, which is the second-hottest year on record after 2024.
World leaders have promised to keep the planet from heating by 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. Scientists interpret the temperature target as a 30-year average, leaving a sliver of hope for meeting the goal after a period of overshoot even as individual months and years begin to cross the threshold.
“For November, global temperatures were 1.54C above preindustrial levels,” said Dr Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of Copernicus Climate Change Service. “The three-year average for 2023-2025 is on track to exceed 1.5C for the first time.”
The agency’s monthly bulletin found that last month was the third-warmest November globally, with “notably” warmer temperatures recorded across northern Canada and the Arctic Ocean. The month was marked by a series of dangerous weather events including cyclones and catastrophic floods that swept away lives and homes across south and south-east Asia.
Average temperatures have risen sharply as a result of the blanket of carbon pollution smothering the Earth, which has strengthened weather extremes from heatwaves to heavy rains, but continue to vary from year to year based on natural factors. Warming El Niño conditions boosted global temperatures during 2023 and 2024 but gave way to weakly cooling La Niña conditions in 2025.
Copernicus found 2025 was tied with 2023 as the second-hottest year on record. “These milestones are not abstract,” said Burgess. “They reflect the accelerating pace of climate change, and the only way to mitigate future rising temperatures is to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
Since the Paris climate agreement in 2015, planet-heating emissions have continued to climb – although the expansion of renewable energy has helped to curb the rise – along with average temperatures and the intensity of weather extremes.
The Copernicus findings echoed analysis from the World Meteorological Organization before the Cop30 summit in Brazil last month. The WMO found 2015 to 2025 would have been the 11 warmest years in an observational record that stretches back to 1850.

3. Get shucking: South Australians urged to eat oysters and donate shells for reef restoration project
Shrimp soundtrack will be played underwater to lure baby oysters in program aimed at fighting algal blooms


South Australians are being urged to feast on local oysters and then donate the shells to restore native reefs, which will filter ocean water and help fight harmful algal blooms.
The program will also involve lumps of limestone being sunk in the ocean, with a soundtrack of snapping shrimp playing on underwater speakers to lure baby oysters in.
Dr Dominic McAfee, a marine ecologist at the University of Adelaide, said before colonisation there were about 1,500km of oyster reefs along the SA coastline, but dredging had rendered them “broken, forgotten and functionally extinct”.
A single oyster filters about 100 litres of water a day, so reefs of them make a significant difference to water quality.
SA has been hit by a devastating toxic algal bloom, which has littered beaches with thousands of dead fish and marine animals, and has been likened to an underwater bushfire.
A Senate inquiry into the bloom recommended funding for “projects that deliver large-scale, long-term marine ecosystem restoration and resilience including meaningful reef restoration along the SA coastline”.

McAfee has been working with the government on its reef restoration plans.
He said the shell donation plan was a way for the public – many of whom have been suffering ecoanxiety amid the ongoing devastation of the algal bloom – to get involved and find agency and purpose.
“People can enjoy eating beautiful SA oysters then recycle those shells to provide this biodegradable, natural substrate, which is what oysters historically used to build reefs,” he said.
“[The reefs] were all dredged out 200 years ago. We removed the reefs, the substrate, so now we collect shells, make sure they’re clean and sterile, and we place them on the sea floor and try to get oysters to come and live on them.”
The shells will be put in a biodegradable cage. As baby oysters settle on them, they produce a substance that cements the reefs together.
McAfee said his team has shown underwater speakers playing the sound of a healthy reef dramatically increases the number of oysters per metre.
Female oysters can release up to 3m microscopic spats – baby oysters – which then float out looking for a place to live.
A healthy reef habitat has “lots of nooks and crannies” where little animals such as snapping shrimp live, he said. His team built an eight-metre “oyster raceway” and played that crackling sound, and the spats were drawn to it.
The state’s climate, environment and water minister, Lucy Hood, said the government was funding the creation of 25 community reefs that would use donated shells and four large-scale limestone reefs.
Building up wild and native oyster reefs filters the water, creates healthy habitats, restores seagrasses and promotes biodiversity and increased fish stocks, she said.
“You can’t stop this algal bloom from happening but communities wanted to know how they can help,” she said.
“They have felt that deep sense of grief and sadness at the sheer loss of marine life and [the impact on their] pristine oceans going through this difficult and unprecedented time.
“So that’s why we launched a volunteer portal and people can look at all the ways they can give back – so they can eat a lot of oysters, mussels and scallops from SA, then we sunbake them [to dry them and sterilise them] and use them for community oyster reefs.”
Another project run with the fishing conservation charity OzFish will involve volunteers collecting seagrass seeds, which then get sewn into hessian bags and put on the ocean floor to restore the seagrass fields.
The projects are part of a joint state and federal summer plan to help the community and industry recover from the bloom, and for research and monitoring.
While it was initially thought the bloom was mostly composed of the Karenia mikimotoi species, which prefers warmer waters, testing has shown the dominant species is Karenia cristata, which prefers relatively cooler waters.
That has fuelled some hope the bloom will not worsen over the warmer months.
Hood said testing showed levels of chlorophyll-a (which indicates the concentration of algae) had reduced, and said she was “cautiously optimistic”.
People who wish to get involved in the restoration projects or donate shells can visit the government’s algal bloom response website.

4. Three-metre giant oarfish, ‘palace messenger’ of doom, washes up on Tasmanian beach
The enormous, serpentine fish, regarded in Japanese folklore as a herald of disaster, usually live deep below the surface and are only sighted when sick or dying

Three-metre giant oarfish, ‘palace messenger’ of doom, washes up on Tasmanian beach
The enormous, serpentine fish, regarded in Japanese folklore as a herald of disaster, usually live deep below the surface and are only sighted when sick or dying
It was a beautiful warm day in north-west Tasmania when a fish with a reputation as a harbinger of doom washed ashore.
Tony Cheesman, who lives in the seaside town of Penguin, was walking his two dogs, Ronan and Custard, along the beach at Preservation Bay on Friday morning when something silvery and surrounded by gulls grabbed his attention.
“When I got to it, I saw this massive fish, then I noticed the beautiful colours, and it had these long fans coming out of its chin and the top of its head,” he said. “I’d never seen anything like it.”
Prof Culum Brown, an expert in fish at Macquarie University, said there were several species of oarfish, but the three-metre specimen found at Penguin was probably the largest and most well-known – the giant oarfish.
“They’re a very unusual looking fish,” he said. “They’re super long and skinny, kind of like a ribbon, and they have a continuous dorsal fin.”
Giant oarfish could grow up to eight or nine metres, he said, but because they lived 200 to 1,500 metres below the surface, they were rarely seen. “They only ever show up at the surface when they’re sick or dying,” he said.
In Japanese folklore, oarfish were known as ryūgū-no-tsukai, which translated to “the sea god’s palace messenger”, Brown said, and their arrival was thought to herald calamity, such as an earthquake or a tsunami.
But they were an unreliable harbinger of doom, according to one study, which found no link between sightings of these slender sea creatures and imminent disaster.
“Oarfish just rock up at random,” Brown said. “We don’t know very much about them. So any specimen that washes up is really valuable.”
Oarfish were also connected to myths about sea serpents, said David Waldron, an associate professor and historian at Federation University.
“When they come to the surface, which is when sailors in the 19th and 18th century would see them, it would be when they’re ill and thrashing about and not able to maintain their normal depth underwater.”
One Australian newspaper even reported the discovery of “a supposed sea serpent” at Penguin, Tasmania in 1878, with an engraving of the “mystic creature” looking very much like an oarfish.
Enormous, brightly coloured, distinctive, and extremely rare, their legendary appeal was similar to other creatures from the deep – like the giant squid, they were fascinating and mysterious, Waldron said. “It’s a very spectacular looking fish.”
Was this one a harbinger of doom? Cheesman didn’t think so. “It was too nice a day for that.”

5. Caribbean reefs have lost 48% of hard coral since 1980, study finds
‘Destructive’ marine heatwaves driving loss of microalgae that feed coral, says Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network
Caribbean reefs have half as much hard coral now as they did in 1980, a study has found.

The 48% decrease in coral cover has been driven by climate breakdown, specifically marine heatwaves. They affect the microalgae that feed coral, making them toxic and forcing the coral to expel them.

In 2023-24, the region’s coral experienced “the most destructive thermal stress ever recorded”, said Dr Jérémy Wicquart of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, one of the study’s editors. It caused a 16.9% decrease in cover year-on-year.

Forty years ago, a diver would have seen a colourful, vibrant ecosystem that nurtured hundreds of marine species such as spiny lobsters, queen conchs, parrotfish, turtles and sharks. Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the world’s seafloor, but support at least 25% of marine species.

But when Wicquart went diving last year after a conference in Puerto Morelos, Mexico, he was met with bone-white, dying coral.

“All the corals were bleached. All white corals. I was very affected by that. It’s totally different when you see it in the field to when you see it on a graph.”

The bleaching effect is caused by the loss of essential microalgae, which nourish hard coral and give it colour. Without that microalgae the hard coral can recover, but is more often at risk of dying. The destruction is exacerbated by cyclones which buffet the coral, turning it to rubble on the ocean floor.

Coral reefs in the Caribbean generate $6.2bn (£4.6bn) a year through fisheries and tourism, with reef tourism accounting for 10% of the Caribbean’s GDP.

But where there was once coral, macroalgae is thriving. Without competition from coral, its coverage has increased by 85% since 1980. Its growth is encouraged by human activities in the area – overfishing their herbivorous predators in particular.

The study, which was compiled by more than 300 scientists in 44 countries and territories, also highlights conservation successes, which provide hope for the future. The southern Gulf of Mexico has faced severe heat stress since 2023, and yet there researchers discovered old, resilient, coral colonies, free from disease and containing critically endangered coral species.

As a result, the Mexican government created a new marine protection area in the Gulf which connects two existing national parks. Combined, they form a continuous corridor of reef habitats that allow corals and reef species to thrive.

“The science is unequivocal, but it also points to hope. When pressures are reduced and resources are sustained, Caribbean reefs rebound,” said Sinikinesh Beyene Jimma, chief of marine and coastal ecosystems at the UN environment programme.

The Caribbean’s coral reefs are unique because of the dense human population that surrounds them. The number of people living within 20km of coral reefs has increased by 27.6% since 2000.

This means the reefs are more susceptible to local human activity, on top of human-induced climate change. It also means people have the agency to restore reefs with the right management techniques.

“If you act on climate change, you will reduce thermal stress to coral reefs, and the impact of cyclones. The second major solution is to reduce local threats. You can improve water quality by putting in place better wastewater management. You can restrict mass tourism, and implement marine protected areas. These are ways to improve the coral reef at a local scale,” said Wicquart.

6. It’s the world’s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its future
Tapanuli orangutans survive only in Indonesia’s Sumatran rainforest where a mine expansion will cut through their home. Yet the mining company says the alternative will be worse
Asmall brown line snakes its way through the rainforest in northern Sumatra, carving 300 metres through dense patches of meranti trees, oak and mahua. Picked up by satellites, the access road – though modest now – will soon extend 2km to connect with the Tor Ulu Ala pit, an expansion site of Indonesia’s Martabe mine. The road will help to unlock valuable deposits of gold, worth billions of dollars in today’s booming market. But such wealth could come at a steep cost to wildlife and biodiversity: the extinction of the world’s rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutan.
This is absolutely the wrong place to be digging for gold
Amanda Hurowitz, Mighty Earth
The network of access roads planned for this swath of tropical rainforest will cut through habitat critical to the survival of the orangutans, scientists say. The Tapanuli (Pongo tapanuliensis), unique to Indonesia, was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 – distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apes. Today, there are fewer than 800 Tapanulis left in an area that covers as little as 2.5% of their historical range. All are found in Sumatra’s fragile Batang Toru ecosystem, bordered on its south-west flank by the Martabe mine, which began operations in 2012.
“This is absolutely the wrong place to be digging for gold,” says Amanda Hurowitz, who coordinates the forest commodities team at Mighty Earth, a conservation nonprofit monitoring developments at the open-pit mine. “And for what? So mountains of gold bullion bars can sit in the vaults of the world’s richest countries.”
Dozens of orangutan nests lie in the vicinity of the mine’s planned expansion, according to Mighty Earth. In late September, construction began on new access roads through the forest around Martabe mine, according to PT Agincourt Resources, a subsidiary of the British multinational Jardine Matheson, which operates the mine. One of the new roads running through secondary forest has already come within 70 metres of a cluster of orangutan nests, Mighty Earth says.
For Jardine Matheson, which acquired the mine in 2018, expansion is critical to their bottom line. In 2020, the company said it would open up a new pit and build the supporting infrastructure to reach at least 460,000 additional ounces of gold hidden within Tor Ulu Ala. Gold mining is intensifying across the world as companies race to capitalise on near-record prices. At today’s rate of more than $4,000 (£3,000) an ounce, Tor Ulu Ala could generate nearly $2bn.
“While we understand the concerns of some critics, without the mine, which is now the income for approximately 3,500 employees – 70% of which are locals that rely on the mine operation – the alternative will be worse,” says Ruli Tanio, the vice-president director of PT Agincourt. “Being responsible miners, we can provide some opportunity for the orangutan in terms of funding.”

But many scientists disagree, saying the expansion of the mine could push the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans to extinction in a few generations. Even removing just 1% of the population a year would ultimately end in extinction, they say, as orangutans only reproduce every six to nine years.
“It doesn’t take much – especially if you start killing orangutan females – for the population to go extinct,” says the biological anthropologist Erik Meijaard, director of the scientific consultancy Borneo Futures and one of the first experts to describe the species.
Concerns about Jardine Matheson’s decision to move ahead with expanding the mine – without an agreed plan in place to reduce impacts to the Tapanulis – have spread beyond the scientific community. Last year, Norway’s $1.6tn sovereign wealth fund sold its holdings in three Jardines firms, citing concerns about the company being responsible for “severe environmental damage”.
Tapanulis, with their frizzy, cinnamon hair and wide faces, are not only the rarest orangutan, but represent the oldest lineage of all orangutan species – descendants of the first ancestral orangutans that arrived in Sumatra from mainland Asia more than 3m years ago.
In Batang Toru, the final holdouts of the species dwell in just three populations – the west block, east block and Sibual-buali reserve – spread across a patch of mountainous forest roughly the size of Rio de Janeiro. (Earlier this year, scientists confirmed they had found a small, isolated cluster of Tapanulis living in a peat swamp about 32km (20 miles) outside Batang Toru.)
“We assume [the Tapanuli] was really widespread a couple of hundred years ago,” says Meijaard. But unsustainable hunting and fragmenting of the forest drove the last of the species to seek refuge in the higher elevations of Batang Toru.
Even before the proposed mine expansion, the Tapanuli was threatened by development. A Chinese-owned hydroelectric project is being built on the Batang Toru River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the ecosystem. The dam would affect an area that contains the highest density of Tapanuli orangutans – about 42 individuals – according to one 2019 assessment in the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology.
The expansion of the Martabe mine represents another blow, squeezing the apes from another side. “The Tapanuli orangutan really cannot afford any losses,” Meijaard says.
The Martabe mine was established in 2008, near the western block of Batang Toru where an estimated 533 Tapanulis are thought to live. The mine’s footprint spans about 650 hectares (1,600 acres), with 2 hectares falling within the Batang Toru ecosystem’s “key biodiversity area”, as designated by conservation NGOs in the Alliance for Zero Extinction.
The notion the mine can kill an orangutan directly has proven to be quite false. Ruli Tanio, PT Agincourt
PT Agincourt says it will expand the mine by about 250 hectares (617 acres) by the end of Martabe’s operational lifespan in 2034, building not only the new pit and access roads, but a large tailings-management facility. This growth includes clearing another 48 hectares of mostly primary forest in the key biodiversity area. But the company says it is also setting aside a 2,000-hectare conservation zone within its concession, as well as creating another “offset” protected area about 40km from the mine site.
“Without the [mining] revenue from this small area, it will be very hard to carry out the conservation work and the restoration work that is planned,” says Christopher Broadbent, a UK-based sustainability consultant to PT Agincourt. “If the mine were to walk away, the unintended consequences would be almost certainly disastrous for the orangutan.”

PT Agincourt estimates its mine’s expansion will directly or indirectly affect between six and 12 orangutans. Tanio says: “Throughout our 13 years of operation, there have been no cases of fatality of orangutan directly from the mining activities.
“The notion the mine can kill an orangutan directly has proven to be quite false.”
But studies show that even indirect effects can take a toll. Female orangutans are particularly sensitive to habitat loss, as they tend not to move when they lose parts of their home range, leaving them at risk of starvation. PT Agincourt says land clearing will proceed slowly, allowing time for the orangutans to move out of the way.
“We don’t know enough to be able to say that every orangutan that moves will find some new forest to call home,” says Phil Aikman, a campaign director at Mighty Earth. Some studies suggest that pushing orangutan groups closer together will lead to social tensions and conflicts. “The big concern here is that mitigation may or may not work.”
For the past five years, environmental advocates as well as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), have pushed to delay new construction until a mutually agreed plan is in place to protect the Tapanuli. For a time, Jardine Matheson voluntarily agreed to a moratorium on construction, engaging with the IUCN’s Avoid, Reduce, Restore and Conserve (ARRC) taskforce, which advises companies on how to avoid ape habitats and reduce impacts. But that agreement expired in December 2022.
You can plant 10,000 hectares of forest … You can push them fast or push them slow. But you’re still pushing them into competition with other orangutans
The primatologist Genevieve Campbell, who leads the taskforce, says Jardine Matheson had made it impossible to proceed as they were unable to share raw data, including orangutan survey data within the mining permit. Jardines says the Indonesian government prevented the company from sharing that information.
But that relationship has improved in recent weeks. In November, PT Agincourt Resources signed a new conditional memorandum of understanding with the ARRC taskforce, allowing their scientists to provide independent input on the mine’s development plans and mitigation strategy.
PT Agincourt told the Guardian it would temporarily pause road construction for three weeks to allow the IUCN to complete its review. The planned protection zones, as well as a new orangutan research centre funded by the mine mean the “Tapanuli will be better off with the mine”, Tanio says.
Campbell disagrees that the mine’s overall impact will be positive for the Tapanuli. “You cannot say that any great ape species is better with mining than without.”
For Meijaard, little can truly compensate for the mine’s effects on the orangutans.
“You can plant 10,000 hectares of forest with lots of fruiting trees … so the orangutans potentially have somewhere to go. You can push them fast or you can push them slow. But you’re still pushing them into competition with other orangutans in an area that is, ecologically, quite restrained for the species.”
“If we really want to protect the species, we have to aim for zero losses,” he says.

7. Drinking water contaminated with Pfas probably increases risk of infant mortality, study finds
Study of 11,000 births in New Hampshire shows residents’ reproductive outcomes near contaminated sites
Drinking water contaminated with Pfas chemicals probably increases the risk of infant mortality and other harm to newborns, a new peer-reviewed study of 11,000 births in New Hampshire finds.
The first-of-its-kind University of Arizona research found drinking well water down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site was tied to an increase in infant mortality of 191%, pre-term birth of 20%, and low-weight birth of 43%.
It was also tied to an increase in extremely premature birth and extremely low-weight birth by 168% and 180%, respectively.
The findings caught authors by surprise, said Derek Lemoine, a study co-author and economics professor at the University of Arizona who focuses on environmental policymaking and pricing climate risks.
“I don’t know if we expected to find effects this big and this detectable, especially given that there isn’t that much infant mortality, and there aren’t that many extremely low weight or pre-term births,” Lemoine said. “But it was there in the data.”
The study also weighed the cost of societal harms in drinking contaminated water against up-front cleanup costs, and found it to be much cheaper to address Pfas water pollution.
Extrapolating the findings to the entire US population, the authors estimate a nearly $8bn negative annual economic impact just in increased healthcare costs and lost productivity. The cost of complying with current regulations for removing Pfas in drinking water is estimated at about $3.8bn.
“We are trying to put numbers on this and that’s important because when you want to clean up and regulate Pfas, there’s a real cost to it,” Lemoine said.
Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.
Pfas are widely used across the economy, and industrial sites that utilize them in high volume often pollute groundwater. Military bases and airports are among major sources of Pfas pollution because the chemicals are used in firefighting foam. The federal government estimated that about 95 million people across the country drink contaminated water from public or private wells.
Previous research has raised concern about the impact of Pfas exposure on fetuses and newborns.
Among those are toxicological studies in which researchers examine the chemicals’ impact on lab animals, but that leaves some question about whether humans experience the same harms, Lemoine said.
Other studies are correlative and look at the levels of Pfas in umbilical cord blood or in newborns in relation to levels of disease. Lemoine said those findings are not always conclusive, in part because many variables can contribute to reproductive harm.
The new natural study is unique because it gets close to “isolating the effect of the Pfas itself, and not anything around it”, Lemoine said.
Researchers achieved this by identifying 41 New Hampshire sites contaminated with Pfoa and Pfos, two common Pfas compounds, then using topography data to determine groundwater flow direction. The authors then examined reproductive outcomes among residents down gradient from the sites.
Researchers chose New Hampshire because it is the only state where Pfas and reproductive data is available, Lemoine said. Well locations are confidential, so mothers were unaware of whether their water source was down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site. That created a randomization that allows for causal inference, the authors noted.
The study’s methodology is rigorous and unique, and underscores “that Pfas is no joke, and is toxic at very low concentrations”, said Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst with the Environmental Working Group non-profit. The group studies Pfas exposures and advocates for tighter regulations.
The study is in part effective because mothers did not know whether they were exposed, which created the randomization, Evans said, but she noted that the state has the information. The findings raise questions about whether the state should be doing a similar analysis and alerting mothers who are at risk, Evans said.
Lemoine said the study had some limitations, including that authors don’t know the mothers’ exact exposure levels to Pfas, nor does the research account for other contaminants that may be in the water. But he added that the findings still give a strong picture of the chemicals’ effects.
Granular activated carbon or reverse osmosis systems can be used by water treatment plants and consumers at home to remove many kinds of Pfas, and those systems also remove other contaminants.
The Biden administration last year put in place limits in drinking water for six types of Pfas, and gave water utilities several years to install systems.
The Trump administration is moving to undo the limits for some compounds. That would probably cost the public more in the long run. Utility customers pay the cost of removing Pfas, but the public “also pays the cost of drinking contaminated water, which is bigger”, Lemoine said.

8. Environment Agency faces landfill tax bill worth millions to clear illegal waste
Exclusive: ‘extremely unhelpful’ policy seen as deterrent to clearing thousands of dump sites across England
Millions of pounds in landfill tax owed to the government has to be paid by the Environment Agency (EA) if it clears any of the thousands of illegal waste dumps across the country.
Of the £15m that taxpayers are paying for the clearance of the only site the agency has committed to clearing up – a vast illegal dump at Hoad’s Wood in Kent – £4m is landfill tax.
John Russell, a Liberal Democrat peer who helped push the agency to clean up Hoad’s Wood, described the situation as ludicrous.
“It is extremely unhelpful … to make the EA pay landfill tax on the illegal waste sites they are trying to clear up,” Russell said. “I strongly encourage the Treasury to take an urgent, fresh, cold hard look at these regulations.”
The cost of the landfill tax has been seen as another reason the EA has not taken action to clear even the most egregious dump sites across the country.
In Wigan, the local MP Josh Simons has been calling for the EA to clean up 25,000 tonnes of rubbish dumped by criminals in a residential street near a primary school for several months.
The agency is refusing to clear the waste at Bolton House Road, Bickershaw, despite the impact on young children and local residents. It has mounted a criminal investigation and sent formal notices to those with an interest in the land requiring that the waste be removed and threatening legal action if they fail to do so.
The illegal dump at Bolton House Road is partly on a field where children used to play sports, and it is causing an environmental hazard, with rat infestations, air pollution and a stench.
One parent who did not want to be named said: “My kids have to go to school every day with that stench and air pollution and they cannot play outside on the field any more. But there is no urgency to clean this up.”
The cleanup cost has been estimated at £4.5m, including the requirement to pay landfill tax on the rubbish.
Another resident said she felt they had been left to suffer in silence, particularly after politicians and the media focused on a mountain of rubbish recently discovered in Kidlington, Oxfordshire.
“Thousands of tonnes of illegally dumped waste have been left to rot here,” she said. “This is a lot of household waste, so you can imagine the issues it is causing; smells, flies, rats. We have had an infestation in our attic and walls, as have some of our neighbours. This is a serious environmental and public health failure.”
In July the dump caught fire and the blaze raged for nine days, forcing the school to close and residents to shut all windows and doors to avoid the toxic fumes.
Simons, the Labour MP for Makerfield, said he alerted the EA in January when rubbish first started being dumped at a rate of 20 truckloads a day but it did not intervene.
“The impact of this blatant criminality continues to be very severe on the community in Bickershaw,” he said. “From lost days of school when the pile caught fire to closed windows on blisteringly hot days, they shouldn’t have to put up with this.”
Organised crime groups are drawn to waste crime because of the millions they can make from a criminal enterprise that costs the taxpayer £1bn a year.
The gangs make millions by exploiting the landfill tax, which is £126 a tonne. Criminals can make £2,500 for each articulated lorryload of waste they dump by pocketing the landfill tax and diverting the waste to an illegal dump.
Russell said making the agency pay the tax showed a complete lack of joined-up government, which was letting criminals get away with their offences while ordinary people suffered.
“We have got a broken system and stuff is swept under the carpet and there is no accountability,” he said. He wants full transparency from the agency on the scale of organised criminals illegally dumping thousands of tonnes of waste.
“We cannot effectively fight that which we do not know. More than numbers, we require location, sizes, types of waste and what action is being taken to clear up these tremendous, huge waste piles,” Russell said.
An EA spokesperson said a criminal investigation was ongoing in Wigan and it was treating the dumping as a critical incident.
“[We are] using all the powers and the enforcement tools available to us to bring the perpetrators to justice and make them pay for this offence,” they said. “Our skilled officers are on site frequently and at the forefront or our minds is the impact this illegal waste is having on the local community.”
Wigan council said it was part of a multiagency partnership including the EA and Greater Manchester police to prevent any further criminal activity on site and to minimise the risks and the impact on neighbouring residents.
The council said: “We understand the impact this site is having on the local community and want the site cleared as a matter of urgency. Unfortunately, the legal and financial landscape for clearing illegal waste sites is complex.”

9. California pesticide agency could loosen restrictions on most toxic rat poisons
The anti-coagulant rodenticides also unintentionally harm wildlife across the state, including endangered species

California pesticide agency could loosen restrictions on most toxic rat poisons
The anti-coagulant rodenticides also unintentionally harm wildlife across the state, including endangered species
The administration of Gavin Newsom, the California governor, is moving to loosen restrictions around the most toxic rat poisons, even as a new state report shows the rodenticides are unintentionally poisoning wildlife across the state, including endangered species.
Blood-thinning, anticoagulant rodenticides were significantly restricted when a 2024 state law approved after 10 years of legislative wrangling required the California department of pesticide regulation to limit the substances’ use unless data showed species collaterally harmed or killed by it had rebounded.
A new report from the California fish and wildlife service, also part of the Newsom administration, shows widespread poisonings of dozens of species, including mountain lions, hawks, owls, bears and bobcats. About 83% of bald eagles tested showed levels of the rodenticides in their blood, and endangered California condors also showed high levels.
Still, the Newsom administration is moving forward with the plans to undo many of the regulations in the new law, a move that points to industry influence, said Jonathan Evans, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.
“You have the agency that has really tracked this issue for decades putting forward this data that shows continued harm to wildlife, but then you have another agency that’s literally trying to roll back laws that the legislature and governor put in place and includes tight restrictions, which is very, very concerning, to say the least,” Evans said.
The pesticides department proposal allows use of the most toxic rat poison to be used at more than 100,000 new locations, including grocery stores, restaurants, highways, roads, and even parks and wildlife areas.
In a statement, a California department of pesticides spokesperson said the agency is “evaluating the risks” of the rodenticides and will consult with the California department of wildlife and fish. The proposed rules include limits on placing the poison within 50ft of a building and limiting the poisons’ use to 35 consecutive days, or 105 calendar days.
The anticoagulant poisons cause a “gruesome” death, Evans said, because they slowly kill an animal by effectively causing it to bleed out internally. It sometimes can take days for an animal to die. The anticoagulants have a long half-life compared with other rat poisons, meaning they stay in rodents for longer, and accumulate in larger predators up the food chain that eat them.
Evans said there was little credible scientific research showing that the anticoagulants are more effective than other poisons, like strychnine, that cause less harm to predators. Still, industry claims the anticoagulants are highly effective, Evans said.

Even when the poisons do not kill the predator, it sickens them, which makes them less likely to survive later. The anticoagulants thin blood, so an animal that sustains wounds in a fight, for example, would have a difficult time healing.
The poisons also cause predators to grow disoriented, and advocates say the rodenticides have been especially hard on mountain lions, which are already under major stress from development pressure, habitat loss, car strikes and other issues.
The “Hollywood Mountain Lion” that lived in Los Angeles captured the public’s attention when he was poisoned by anticoagulants and – disoriented from the toxic substance – was then hit by a car. He died from his injuries.
River otters have also showed poisoning, highlighting the threat to aquatic animals, and the poisons have been especially harmful for great-horned owls and red-shouldered hawks, which are “some of our best natural rodent-controllers”, said Lisa Owens-Viani, director of Raptors Are the Solution, said in a statement.
“Now is hardly the time to relax restrictions when, in fact, our state department of pesticide regulation should close the loopholes in the law to truly protect these animals,” Owens-Viani added.
In part led by efforts from Newsom, whose father was one of the state’s original mountain lion conservationists, the state passed the nation-leading Poison Free Wildlife Act of 2024. Evans said he suspected Newsom was not aware of the proposal.
The pesticides department was largely funded by proceeds from sales of pesticides, Evans added, so it is incentivized to send substances to the marketplace.
Some anticoagulant rules had also gone into effect a few years earlier, but the latest state wildlife department data from 2024 shows little decrease in the amount of anticoagulant found in predators, though data from 2025 is not yet available.
The data may also show very little progress because the law includes a loophole that allows the rodenticides to be used on agricultural land, Evans said. Regardless, the data must show an improvement before the pesticides office can act, Evans added.
A spokesperson for the pesticides department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a powerpoint presentation used to solicit public input on the proposed rule changes provided little explanation of the rationale.
Lawmakers who helped craft the 2024 law sent a letter to the pesticides agency encouraging it to rescind the proposed rule change, stating that the justification was “flimsy and unclear”.
The governor’s response would be revealing, Evans said.
“We know Governor Newsom is concerned about this issue and has taken steps to reduce exposures, so it’s an interesting moment in which we will see if he will continue to back wildlife, or the narrow interest of the pesticide industry,” Evans said.

10. White House rescinds $20m for clean water in pesticide-contaminated rural California
This article is more than 4 months old
EPA said grant to provide clean water was a ‘wasteful DEI program’ as pesticide leaches into residents’ wells.
For decades, thousands of residents in California’s agricultural heartland couldn’t use their wells because the water was too contaminated with pesticides. In December, the Biden administration stepped in with a long-awaited $20m grant to provide clean water, improve municipal sources and relieve the region’s financial and health burden.
The Trump administration just took the money away.
Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) labeled the grant a “wasteful DEI program”, though advocates say the move is an act of cruelty. Drinking water in some parts of the Monterey county region, which largely produces strawberries, has not been safe for decades because it is contaminated with staggering levels of highly toxic pesticide ingredients that threaten the health of agricultural workers and others.
The decision to yank the money was “unjust”, said Maraid Jimenez, a spokesperson for the Community Water Center, which was helping manage the grant’s implementation.
“People agree that everyone needs safe drinking water, so to have a grant help fix that for a rural community rescinded – it doesn’t make any sense to us,” Jimenez said. “The drinking water crisis here only gets worse, and, beyond our shock, we’re trying to mobilize to find a solution.”
The funding, along with California state money, would have improved drinking water quality for about 5,500 people, either through improvements to municipal infrastructure or by connecting contaminated wells to municipal lines.
The aquifer in the rural, majority-Spanish-speaking communities in Monterey county, which sits about 50 miles (80km) south of the San Jose, is widely contaminated with 1,2,3-TCP, a pesticide ingredient and carcinogen banned in 40 countries that persists for decades in the soil and groundwater. In many cases, the 1,2,3-TCP levels in wells have been found to far exceed state limits and EPA health guidelines for drinking water. 1,2,3-TCP can also evaporate and create toxic fumes in the shower, and it is linked to liver, kidney and reproductive damage.
The wells also often contain high levels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and nitrates. Each are carcinogens and the latter can cause “blue baby syndrome”, a condition in young children that causes their skin to turn blue when the toxin gets into their bloodstream and restricts oxygen flow.
Residents have either had to buy jugs of water or use state assistance to purchase them over the last 30 years. Among them is Marcela, a mother of three who has lived in the region for about 10 years. She and her husband are strawberry pickers, and she declined to provide her last name for fear of retaliation from the federal government.
Marcela said the family, which lives near Moss Landing, spends about $450 every three weeks on 5-gallon jugs of water. The well on the property that she rents is broken. She and her landlords, an elderly couple who live at the house and whom she takes care of, don’t have enough money to fix it. Even if they could, the water from the well would in all likelihood be too contaminated to use.
They learned in late 2024 of the plan to connect their property to a nearby water district within three years, which would have alleviated a major stress and financial burden. Then they learned that the Trump administration had rescinded the funding.
“It is devastating news for us,” Marcela said via a translator. “We urgently need water.”
Marcela’s family is protected by the bottled water, but some in the region “didn’t know that they couldn’t drink or cook with the tap water, so they would use it”, said Mayra Hernandez, community advocacy manager with Community Water Center. What that has meant for their health is unclear.

Educating residents about the risks has involved Community Water Center staff knocking on doors. The challenges in getting out the word in the region, where there are a large number of workers who don’t speak English and who live in isolation from information sources, highlights how essential it is to hook up properties to clean water.
The EPA grant, along with state funding, would have connected more than 1,000 residents with unsafe wells to municipal lines. It also would have provided financial support to municipal systems needed to expand water provision and provide improvements.
In an emailed statement, the EPA said: “Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
The cuts are part of the Trump administration’s broader attack aimed at killing approximately $2bn for environmental and climate justice initiatives made available through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that would reduce pollution and improve communities’ resilience to the effects of climate change.
Hundreds of projects across the nation have lost funding, and though lawsuits have sought to restore it, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated all IRA money that was not yet disbursed.
The decision to rescind the funding came at almost the same time that the EPA announced $30m in funding for rural water improvements – a drop in the bucket compared with what was available under the Biden administration. None of the new funding is going to the region around Marcea’s home.
Jimenez said the EPA’s actions “don’t fall in line with their messaging”.
“Drinking water is a human right and it shouldn’t be a political topic that’s contested,” she said.
The Community Water Center is now looking for other sources of funding through the state, but Jimenez added that advocates are determined even if the situation for now remains unclear.
“Just because a grant is being canceled doesn’t mean the problem is going away,” Jimenez said.

вЂThe current could kill an elephantвЂ™: Asia flood survivors describe escaping with their lives
Aminah Ali, 63, was at home in the Pidie Jaya district of IndonesiaвЂ™s Aceh province when the rains started at midnight on Wednesday. The waters rose gradually. It seemed like the usual flooding that happens during monsoon season, but then came a loud roar of water: her village was suddenly inundated.

With help from her son, she managed to clamber on to her rooftop, where she waited for 24 hours. Flood waters, 3 metres high, stretched into the distance. вЂњI saw many houses being swept away,вЂќ she said.

вЂњNow my house is ruined, full of mud. I never imagined a situation like this. Now I only have one shirt left, I donвЂ™t even have any underwear, all my possessions are gone.вЂќ

The monsoon season often brings heavy rains that can cause flooding or trigger landslides, but the levels witnessed over recent days are far more devastating. More than 1,100 people have now been killed across the region after seasonal rains combined with tropical cyclones to inundate IndonesiaвЂ™s Sumatra island вЂ“ where more than 600 people were killed вЂ“ Sri Lanka, southern Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Busra Ishak, 60, also from Pidie Jaya, lost his house, which was swept away without a trace by the force of the waters. вЂњThere were hundreds of tons of logs [in the water], and even an elephant could be killed by the incredibly strong current,вЂќ he said.

He survived by swimming and grabbing on to a coconut tree, where he stayed for more than 12 hours. One of his older sisters was killed. He still hasnвЂ™t been able to tell relatives outside Aceh province because electricity and phone lines are down.

Natchanun Insuwano was among those stranded in Hat Yai, one of the hardest hit areas in Southern Thailand, a region where at least 176 have been killed. He waited, waist deep in water, on the first floor of his flooded home, while his parents balanced precariously through a window, leaning on metal roofing. He was too afraid to perch alongside them, nervous the roof panels below might collapse.

вЂњI could see the current in the water was so strong,вЂќ he said. Sofas, TV and home appliances rushed past in the muddy waters.

From Sunday 23 November to Tuesday 25, Natchanun and his parents had just one bottle of water to share. вЂњI looked in the sky to see if a helicopter or drone might drop some food,вЂќ he said. Nothing came. вЂњIt rained all night so we were so cold with the rain and wind.вЂќ He messaged every hotline he could see and posted on social media to ask for help.

The family had listened to the advice of the local authority, which had suggested the water levels would be manageable. When a national disaster agency told residents to evacuate, it was too late вЂ“ waters had already rapidly reached chest-level.

The failure of Thai authorities to give adequate warning has been strongly criticised.

On Tuesday morning, Natchanun was able to flag down a nearby volunteer rescue boat after shouting at the top of his lungs. вЂњMy mom was very weak and unconscious. I just knew we needed to get out of this place so I shouted and shouted,вЂќ said Natchanun.

His mother, who was carried out on a stretcher and given first aid, has recovered. They still havenвЂ™t returned home, he said. Water has not been restored, and everything is caked in mud.

Chutikan Panpit, 32, who also lives in Hat Yai, believes it is a miracle she is alive. She had walked on to her terrace to check water levels when she was bitten by a Malayan pit viper. Waters were so high that she could not reach a hospital for 32 hours. The pain was worse than childbirth, she said.

вЂњI was scared of dying. My son just turned one. He just learned how to say вЂmummyвЂ™ a few days earlier. In the [rescue] boat I was so scared but I just thought of my sonвЂ™s face,вЂќ she said. The current was so strong that rescuers told her to hold on tightly as they accelerated rapidly to move through the surges of water.

вЂњWith this snake (a Malayan pit viper) and 32 hours, people say either you die or have to amputate the leg,вЂќ she said. вЂњMy parents were so scared, they prayed and prayed and tried everything to wish for me to be safe.вЂќ

Waters have now receded in Hat Yai, though the scale of the recovery and clean-up work needed is immense. Tens of thousands of homes are damaged. Debris вЂ“ broken, muddied furniture, strips of wood and rubbish вЂ“ is strewn in the streets. Many residents have lost almost all their belongings. Today, just the sound of rain is enough to induce panic.

On Sumatra, the largest Indonesian island, at least 11 bridges connecting different regions and sections of the national highway have been cut off. Some villages are still completely inaccessible by road. Even in areas that have been reached by recovery teams, local people say they do not have enough food or clean water.

Many flood victims remain at rescue shelters, relying mostly on donors in the community for food and drinks. Others are trying to salvage what remains. Busra has gone to his brotherвЂ™s home to try to clean and protect his valuables. The disaster is far worse than any flooding in previous years, he said: вЂњThis yearвЂ™s flood is the worst tragedy in history.вЂќ

вЂThose who eat Chilean salmon cannot imagine how much human blood it carries with itвЂ™
Julia CГЎrcamo LГіpezвЂ™s house faces the sea, near enough to hear the gulls calling through the salt-encrusted windows. She lives in the small town of MaullГ­n, on the edge of ChileвЂ™s Patagonia, an area where almost everyone works in the fishing industry.

Outside, it is drizzling and the sky is darkening as she recalls 1 May 2019, one of the worst days of her life. вЂњTwo men knocked on my door and told me they had bad news: my husband had had an accident while working at sea,вЂќ she says. Since then, she has discovered that the accident seems to have been caused by negligence.

An autopsy proved that Arturo Vera, 59, a diver at one of ChileвЂ™s salmon farms, was struck by a boatвЂ™s propeller and injured in the head, ribs and throat. He had been working at the Taraba fish farm in Puerto Natales, in Magallanes, the southernmost region of Chilean Patagonia. Divers working in the salmon farm say the fatal injuries happened in violation of safety regulations, at a time when the boatвЂ™s engine was supposed to be turned off. The family claims to have received compensation in court.

Following VeraвЂ™s death, the company was fined for violations of labour and safety regulations identified by the labour inspector. The company was approached but did not respond to requests for comment.

ChileвЂ™s fast-growing salmon industry has been tied to deadly labour conditions, rampant antibiotic use and severe environmental damage, putting workers and communities at risk. Indigenous groups and small-scale fishers report polluted waters, vanishing wildlife and threats to their cultural practices.

вЂњOver the last 12 years, the salmon industry in Chile has had the highest rate of accidents and deaths at work in the aquaculture sector globally,вЂќ says Juan Carlos Cardenas, director of Ecoceanos, a conservationist NGO. вЂњBetween March 2013 and July 2025, 83 workers died in accidents in the sector.вЂќ

Meanwhile, Norway has reported only three worker deaths in the salmon industry over the last 34 years, according to Ecoceanos.

вЂњThose who eat Chilean salmon cannot imagine how much human blood it carries with it,вЂќ says one source working on a farm in Chilean Patagonia.

Salmon is not native to ChileвЂ™s waters. The first specimens were imported from Norway more than 40 years ago during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.

ChileвЂ™s salmon farms, or salmoneras, are the worldвЂ™s second-largest producer of salmon after Norway, and fish is one of the countryвЂ™s biggest exports. Between 1990 and 2017, the industry increased production by almost 3,000%, with more than 750,000 tonnes exported to more than 80 countries.

Chile is the leading supplier of salmon to the US, exporting 56,474 tonnes of the fish worth $760m (ВЈ575m) in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

According to data from the Chilean government, from 2003 to 2024, imports of Chilean salmon into Europe grew from $56m to $204m, and the EU is now the sixth-largest market for Chilean salmon imports.

Yet the industryвЂ™s expansion has been at least partly driven by poor production practices that pose risks to human safety and the environment. A widespread use of chemicals and antibiotics pollutes water, destroying ecosystems and threatening other marine species.

While in 2024, Norway declared that it had used virtually no antibiotics in its farms, Chilean farms used more than 351 tonnes. This figure represents an improvement over 2014, when 563 tonnes were used, but it remains very high, given that studies suggest 70% to 80% of the antibiotics administered to salmon can end up in the environment.

Eating animals that have been treated with antibiotics can lead to antimicrobial resistance, and could promote the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans.

Small-scale fishers say they can no longer survive on fishing because many species, including sea urchins and mussels, are scarce due to pollution from the salmoneras.

Jorge Ampuero GonzГЎlez, head of the provincial Labour Inspectorate in Puerto Natales, says he does not have the personnel or equipment to inspect farms that can take up to 12 hours to reach by sea. His team of seven oversees 30 salmon farms but has no boats or helicopters.

вЂњRealistically, we can visit each centre once a year, at most twice. However much we want to, it is really difficult to change things with these tools,вЂќ says Ampuero GonzГЎlez, who believes the industry needs improvement. вЂњThere is a lack of understanding that the sustainability of the industry does not depend only on how much salmon we produce, but on the conditions in which we produce it.вЂќ

The Chilean minister for the environment, the undersecretary for fisheries, the director of ChileвЂ™s national fisheries and aquaculture service (Sernapesca), the director of Salmonchile, the leading trade association of Chilean salmon producers, and the companies involved were approached for comment.

Pollution affects not just the Patagonian Sea, where salmon are raised, but also the freshwater stages of fish farming. The initial phase, including fertilisation and egg hatching, occurs mainly in ChileвЂ™s rivers in AraucanГ­a and Los RГ­os. A notable case alleging contamination involves the Chesque Alto community in AraucanГ­a, which has been engaged in a lengthy legal fight against a local salmon company.

Near the polluted Chesque River stands a small wooden house where Angelica Urrutia, 35, and her family live. In a separate case, her community, the Mapuche вЂ“ the largest Indigenous group in Chile вЂ“ has taken legal action against the Sociedad Comercial AgrГ­cola y Forestal Nalcahue (Nalcahue Agricultural and Forestry Commercial Society Ltd), which farms salmon in the area.

вЂњSince the company set up shop,вЂќ says Urrutia, вЂњthe fish in the river have disappeared, as has the rest of the wildlife, especially the birds. When they were forced to stop in 2021 because of our complaint, the fish and other animals returned.вЂќ

According to community members, some parts of the Chesque River have turned reddish and slimy due to pollution, a phenomenon also observed in other areas of Chile where salmon farms have been set up near rivers.

вЂњIn 2005, four of our cows drank water near the companyвЂ™s drain and all died. The vet who examined them said they had ingested a lot of formalin,вЂќ says Urrutia, referring to an allegedly carcinogenic chemical frequently used in salmon farming in Chile to eliminate parasites.

Urrutia says representatives of a salmon farming company came to their home and offered to buy them some sheep. вЂњThey do this so they can continue to work in peace,вЂќ says Urrutia. вЂњMany of our neighbours are in favour of the company setting up here precisely because of these вЂincentivesвЂ™.вЂќ

Yet, many residents are concerned about their health because they drink river water and use it daily in their homes. The salmon company was established in the area almost 30 years ago, in 1998, and, thanks to the legal battle fought by the Urrutia community in 2021, its activities had to be halted for about eight months. The company now faces an administrative sanctioning procedure, but continues to operate while it is ongoing.

Urrutia, who is a вЂњmachiвЂќ, an ancestral figure who is a pillar of support for the Indigenous groups in the area, treating its members with medicinal herbs and rituals, says there are other aspects of her peopleвЂ™s lives that are affected by salmon companies.

вЂњI can no longer gather the medicinal herbs that grow around the river,вЂќ she says. вЂњAnd the company has contaminated several areas of the river that my community has always used for our ancestral ceremonies. When the company had to stop, we were able to perform our sacred ceremonies in the river again. It was beautiful.вЂќ

3 60,000 African penguins starved to death after sardine numbers collapsed вЂ“ study
More than 60,000 penguins in colonies off the coast of South Africa have starved to death as a result of disappearing sardines, a new paper has found.

More than 95% of the African penguins in two of the most important breeding colonies, on Dassen Island and Robben Island, died between 2004 and 2012. The breeding penguins probably starved to death during the moulting period, according to the paper, which said the climate crisis and overfishing were driving declines.

The losses that researchers recorded in those colonies were not isolated, said the paper, which was published in Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology. вЂњThese declines are mirrored elsewhere,вЂќ said Dr Richard Sherley, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter. The African penguin species has undergone a population decline of nearly 80% in 30 years.

African penguins shed and replace their worn-out feathers every year to protect their insulation and waterproofing. However, during the moulting period, which takes about 21 days, they have to stay on land. To survive this fasting period, they need to fatten up beforehand. вЂњIf food is too hard to find before they moult or immediately afterwards, they will have insufficient reserves to survive the fast,вЂќ said Sherley. вЂњWe donвЂ™t find large rafts of carcasses вЂ“ our sense is that they probably die at sea,вЂќ he said.

For every year except three since 2004, the biomass of the sardine species Sardinops sagax had fallen to 25% of its maximum abundance off the coast of western South Africa, the study found. The fish are a key food for African penguins. Changes in the temperature and salinity off the west coast of Africa have made the fishesвЂ™ spawning less successful. Levels of fishing, however, have remained high in the region.

In 2024, African penguins were classified as critically endangered, with fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs left.

More sustainable fisheries management could improve the penguinsвЂ™ chances of survival. Conservationists are taking action on the ground, by building artificial nests to shelter chicks, managing predators and hand-rearing adults and chicks who need rescuing. Commercial purse-seine fishing, which involves encircling a school of fish with a large net and then trapping them by closing the bottom, has been banned around the six largest penguin-breeding colonies in South Africa.

It is hoped this will вЂњincrease access to prey for penguins at critical parts of their life cycleвЂќ, said the study co-author Dr Azwianewi Makhado, from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment in South Africa.

Lorien Pichegru, a professor of marine biology at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa, who was not involved in the study, said the results were вЂњextremely concerningвЂќ and highlighted decades-long mismanagement of small fish populations in South Africa. вЂњThe results of the study are only based on penguinsвЂ™ survival until 2011, but the situation has not improved over time,вЂќ she said.

Pichegru said addressing extremely low levels of small fish stocks required urgent action, вЂњnot only for African penguins but also for other endemic species depending on these stocksвЂќ.

Just not that into ewes: вЂgay sheepвЂ™ escape slaughter and take over a New York catwalk
When a ram tips its head back, curls its upper lip, and takes a deep breath вЂ“ what is known in the world of animal husbandry as a вЂњflehmen responseвЂќ вЂ“ it is often a sign of arousal. Sheep have a small sensory organ located above the roof of the mouth, and the flehmen response helps to flood it with any sex pheromones wafting about.

Usually, rams flehmen when they encounter ewes during the mating period, according to Michael StГјcke, a farmer with 30 years of experience raising sheep in Westphalia, Germany. But on StГјckeвЂ™s farm, the rams flehmen вЂњall the timeвЂќ.

вЂњThey do this all the time, because they find each other attractive,вЂќ said StГјcke of his 35 male sheep. вЂњTheyвЂ™re cuddling. TheyвЂ™re showing signs of affection. TheyвЂ™re jumping on each other. ItвЂ™s undeniable that theyвЂ™re attracted to each other.вЂќ

StГјcke is the proud shepherd of the worldвЂ™s first and probably only flock of gay rams. Though researchers have found that as many as 8% of male sheep are вЂњmale-orientedвЂќ, homosexuality is viewed disfavorably by most farmers, who expect rams to perform a breeding function. Rams who refuse to breed are often slaughtered for meat, and it was during a discussion of this harsh reality with StГјckeвЂ™s friend and business partner Nadia Leytes that the idea for Rainbow Wool was born: вЂњWhat can we do to not send all of them to the slaughterhouse?вЂќ

вЂњMy heart beats for the weak and oppressed in general,вЂќ StГјcke told the Guardian, with Leytes translating. вЂњI am gay myself and know the prejudices and obstacles that come with being a gay man, especially in the agricultural business.вЂќ

Rainbow WoolвЂ™s solution has been to buy gay rams directly from breeders, outbidding the price they might receive from a slaughterhouse, and keep them for their wool. The flock now numbers 35, and the farm has a waiting list. Individual sheep can be named and sponsored вЂ“ they include a Bentheimer landschaf named Wolli Wonka, a Shropshire named Prince Wolliam, and Jean Woll Gaultier вЂ“ and the wool is processed by a mill in Spain. All profits are donated to LGBTQ+ charities in Germany. вЂњA couple of sheep [have been] saved but also a couple of people,вЂќ Leytes said, noting that their donations have supported relocating people living in countries where being gay is illegal.

Correctly identifying a sheepвЂ™s sexual orientation can be tricky. вЂњEverybody can just say: вЂHey I have a gay ram,вЂ™вЂќ StГјcke said, вЂњbut what weвЂ™re doing is observing their behavior.вЂќ

вЂњSome rams basically jump on everything, whether itвЂ™s female or male,вЂќ he added. вЂњThat would not qualify as being a gay ram. That would qualify as being a dominant. But if a ram consistently refuses to mate with a female sheep, this is the sign that you know he prefers other rams.вЂќ

StГјckeвЂ™s flock burst on to the fashion scene last month when they provided the raw material for a knitwear collection designed by Chrome Hearts collaborator Michael Schmidt and sponsored by the gay dating app Grindr. Schmidt sent 36 looks down a New York City catwalk, all knit or crocheted from the wool of StГјckeвЂ™s gay sheep. Each look represented a male archetype, starting with Adam sans Eve and including a pool boy, sailor, pizza delivery boy, plumber and leather daddy.

вЂњI really wanted to lean into the gay,вЂќ Schmidt told the New York Times. вЂњI view it as an art project. ItвЂ™s selling an idea more than a collection of clothing, and the idea itвЂ™s selling is that homosexuality is not only part of the human condition, but of the animal world. That puts the lie to this concept that being gay is a choice. ItвЂ™s part of nature.вЂќ

The naturalness of homosexuality as demonstrated by the gayness of sheep has been a subject of media fascination for decades, thanks in large part to Charles Roselli, a professor of biochemistry at Oregon Health and Science University. RoselliвЂ™s research into how sex hormones affect brain development is the source of the statistic about one in 12 rams being gay.

In 2007, his work fell victim to what the New York Times called вЂњa textbook example of the distortion and vituperation that can result when science meets the global news cycleвЂќ when the Times, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) and some gay rights activists accused Roselli вЂ“ inaccurately вЂ“ of seeking to вЂњcureвЂќ homosexuality in rams and, ultimately, humans. (Roselli did not respond to an interview request from the Guardian.)

Rainbow Wool has not been targeted with the same degree of vitriol вЂ“ a snarky Telegraph headline about a supposed вЂњwoke testвЂќ for New YorkвЂ™s fashion scene notwithstanding вЂ“ but StГјcke has been moving the gay flock from field to field to ensure their safety after receiving online threats. вЂњNobody knows where they are stationed because thereвЂ™s a lot of haters,вЂќ Leyte said.

Still, the project has faced criticism for whitewashing the realities of animal farming, which demand вЂњbrutal, violent heteronormativityвЂќ, the scholars Gabriel N Rosenberg and Jan Dutkiewicz wrote in the New Republic. вЂњIf anything, the gay wool fashion show should make us think not about the good fortune of the few rescued rams but about how animal farming systematically, routinely, and often violently exploits the reproduction of all the animals it encounters.вЂќ

Rosenberg and Dutkiewicz point to a number of problems with ascribing human identities such as вЂњgaynessвЂќ to animals, including the fact that researchers only classify sexuality based on вЂњtoppingвЂќ behavior, and have no way to register a ramвЂ™s preference for вЂњbottomingвЂќ. вЂњYou canвЂ™t ask rams about their identities, and we have no evidence that sheep ascribe any special significance to sex in the way humans often do,вЂќ they write. вЂњCalling rams gay risks either imputing human thoughts and feelings to sheep вЂ¦ or distorting what people mean by gay.вЂќ

The limits of how far any kind of biological essentialism can get in helping to justify human rights through appeals to naturalism became immediately clear when I asked Stucke whether Rainbow Wool had any plans to provide sanctuary for lesbian sheep.

вЂњI am personally convinced there are lesbian sheep, and I would like to create a new herd out of them, but itвЂ™s really hard to determine,вЂќ Stucke said. A key problem is that itвЂ™s impossible to know female sheepвЂ™s sexual preferences. вЂњThe act of being jumped on happens without consent in most cases, especially if the female herd is being kept for profit вЂ“ for lambs or for meat,вЂќ he said.

Once a farmer starts taking an animalвЂ™s consent into account, is it possible to still be a farmer? What about the sheep who prefer not to be shorn? Or eaten? Every year, approximately 6.5bn male chicks are вЂњshredded aliveвЂќ soon after they hatch, for the crime of being born male; female chicks get to live вЂ“ but only for as long as they produce eggs.

StГјcke is conscious of the limits of comparisons between farm animals and humans, but he nevertheless finds meaning and purpose in tending to his flock of gay sheep.

вЂњI had some times when it was not easy for me to accept who I was and how I was wired, especially growing up in a very conservative family,вЂќ he said. вЂњI needed to find myself, and I found myself, and this is now something that I treat with openness.

вЂњIf we can save an animal who is living in a different way, it sends a powerful message. It doesnвЂ™t have to be a direct comparison to say animals are just like people. ItвЂ™s metaphorical.вЂќ

Hole in Antarctic ozone layer shrinks to smallest since 2019, scientists say
The hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic this year was the smallest and shortest-lived since 2019, according to European space scientists, who described the finding as a вЂњreassuring signвЂќ of the layerвЂ™s recovery.

The yearly gap in what scientists have called вЂњplanetary sunscreenвЂќ reached a maximum area of 21m sq km (8.1m sq miles) over the southern hemisphere in September вЂ“ well below the maximum of 26m sq km reached in 2023 вЂ“ and shrank in size until coming to an early close on Monday, data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams) shows.

It marks the second year in a row of smaller holes in the ozone layer, after a series of larger and longer-lasting holes that appeared between 2020 and 2023.

вЂњThe earlier closure and relatively small size of this yearвЂ™s ozone hole is a reassuring sign,вЂќ said Laurence Rouil, the director of Cams. вЂњ[It] reflects the steady year-on-year progress we are now observing in the recovery of the ozone layer thanks to the ODS [ozone-depleting substances] ban.вЂќ

The ozone layer, a stratospheric shield that protects life on Earth from ultraviolet (UV) rays, has been worn down by human pollution. However, since ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out by the 1987 Montreal protocol and a series of amendments that followed, it has begun to recover.

A study in Nature Climate Change last year found the actions had successfully curbed emissions, and led to the heating effects of the gases peaking five years earlier than expected. The World Meteorological Organization estimates that the ban will enable a recovery of the ozone layer over the Antarctic, where it is thinnest, to 1980 levels by 2066.

Scientists are still working to understand why the ozone holes were so big and persistent between 2020 and 2023. They suspect that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in 2022, which spewed ash and water vapour into the stratosphere, played a significant role in the large 2023 ozone hole.

Cams said large holes in recent years showed the decline in global stratospheric ozone could have reached вЂњcatastrophic levelsвЂќ without successful agreements to phase out pollutants.

вЂњThis progress should be celebrated as a timely reminder of what can be achieved when the international community works together to address global environmental challenges,вЂќ said Rouil.

A lack of ozone in the stratosphere allows more UV radiation to reach the surface of the Earth, damaging crops, increasing cases of skin cancer and cataracts, and causing other harms to human health.

Last week, Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US ranked the 2025 ozone hole as the fifth smallest since 1992.

Paul Newman, the leader of the ozone research team at NasaвЂ™s Goddard Space Flight Center, said the change in the size of holes was following predictions.

вЂњTheyвЂ™re forming later in the season and breaking up earlier,вЂќ he said. вЂњBut we still have a long way to go before it recovers to 1980s levels.вЂќ

How to turn excess nuts and seeds into a barnstoming festive pudding вЂ“ recipe | Waste not
Last Christmas we visited my in-laws in Cape Town, where, at over 30C, a traditional Christmas pudding just didnвЂ™t feel quite right. But my mother-in-law and her friend created the most delicious feast: a South African braai (barbecue) followed by an incredible ice-cream Christmas pudding made by mashing vanilla ice-cream with a mix of tutti frutti, candied peel, raisins and cherries. This semifreddo is a take on that dessert: a light frozen custard that still carries all the festive flavours.Tutti frutti semifreddo Christmas pudding

We stopped using clingfilm in our kitchen 15 years ago now, because itвЂ™s not easily recycled and because of health concerns about the possible transfer of microplastics into our food. Most semifreddo recipes tell you to line the freezer container with clingfilm, but I suggest using no liner at all, or silicone-free, unbleached baking paper instead.

If, like me, you donвЂ™t love traditional Christmas pudding, then this ice-cream alternative might be just the ticket. ItвЂ™s easy to make in advance, a little decadent and delivers festive cheer.

Anna Jones is one of the best food writers of our generation вЂ“ her recipes are wholesome, adventurous and always easy to cook вЂ“ and this recipe is adapted from her original, but tweaked to incorporate the flavours of Christmas pudding. I like how she skips the usual ribboning process, when youвЂ™d normally whisk the yolks and sugar over a bain-marie, simply by adding creme fraiche or mascarpone. IвЂ™ve slightly increased the amount of creme fraiche to use up a whole pot and made the ingredients flexible, so you can use up whatever nuts, candied peel or spices you have in your cupboard.

Serves 8

200g mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit (eg, glacГ© cherries, raisins or chopped apricots); even a few crushed biscuits are tastyFinely grated zest and juice of Вј lemon or orange2 tbsp brandy, whisky, rum or marsala1 tsp ground mixed spices (eg, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom or allspice)3 large eggs, separated120g icing sugar300ml double cream 200g creme fraiche, or 200ml extra double cream100g mixed nuts (eg, almonds, pistachios or hazelnuts), roughly chopped, plus extra to finish50g dark chocolate, finely chopped (optional), plus extra to finish

Line a large pudding basin or loaf tin with baking paper. In a small bowl, macerate the mixed candied peel, stem ginger and/or dried fruit with the citrus zest and juice, the alcohol and your chosen spices.

Separate the eggs into two clean bowls. Whisk the whites until firm. To the yolks, add the icing sugar, whisk until thick and pale, then beat in the macerated fruit.

In another bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks, then whisk in the creme fraiche (or more double cream) until just combined. Gently fold this through the egg yolk mixture, then gently fold in the egg whites вЂ“ use a large metal spoon to keep the mix airy. Finally, stir in the roughly chopped mixed nuts and finely chopped dark chocolate, if using.

Spoon into the lined basin, cover with a plate or baking paper, and freeze for at least six hours or overnight. For the best results, move the semifreddo to the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to serve. Turn out on to a plate, top with extra nuts and grated chocolate, then slice and serve.

ItвЂ™s the worldвЂ™s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its future

AВ small brown line snakes its way through the rainforest in northern Sumatra, carving 300 metres through dense patches of meranti trees, oak and mahua. Picked up by satellites, the access road вЂ“ though modest now вЂ“ will soon extend 2km to connect with the Tor Ulu Ala pit, an expansion site of IndonesiaвЂ™s Martabe mine. The road will help to unlock valuable deposits of gold, worth billions of dollars in todayвЂ™s booming market. But such wealth could come at a steep cost to wildlife and biodiversity: the extinction of the worldвЂ™s rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutan.

The network of access roads planned for this swath of tropical rainforest will cut through habitat critical to the survival of the orangutans, scientists say. The Tapanuli (Pongo tapanuliensis), unique to Indonesia, was only discovered by scientists to be a separate species in 2017 вЂ“ distinct from the Sumatran and Bornean apes. Today, there are fewer than 800 Tapanulis left in an area that covers as little asВ 2.5%В of their historical range. All are found in SumatraвЂ™s fragile Batang Toru ecosystem, bordered on its south-west flank by the Martabe mine, which began operations in 2012.

вЂњThis is absolutely the wrong place to be digging for gold,вЂќ says Amanda Hurowitz, who coordinates the forest commodities team at Mighty Earth, a conservation nonprofit monitoring developments at the open-pit mine. вЂњAnd for what? So mountains of gold bullion bars can sit in the vaults of the worldвЂ™s richest countries.вЂќ

Dozens of orangutan nests lie in the vicinity of the mineвЂ™s planned expansion, according to Mighty Earth. In late September, construction began on new access roads through the forest around Martabe mine, according to PT Agincourt Resources, a subsidiary of the British multinational Jardine Matheson, which operates the mine. One of the new roads running through secondary forest has already come within 70 metres of a cluster of orangutan nests, Mighty Earth says.

For Jardine Matheson, which acquired the mine in 2018, expansion is critical to their bottom line. In 2020, the company said it would open up a new pit and build the supporting infrastructure to reach at least 460,000 additional ounces of gold hidden within Tor Ulu Ala. Gold mining is intensifying across the world as companies race to capitalise on near-record prices. At todayвЂ™s rate of more than $4,000 (ВЈ3,000) an ounce, Tor Ulu Ala could generate nearly $2bn.

вЂњWhile we understand the concerns of some critics, without the mine, which is now the income for approximately 3,500 employees вЂ“ 70% of which are locals that rely on the mine operation вЂ“ the alternative will be worse,вЂќ says Ruli Tanio, the vice-president director of PT Agincourt. вЂњBeing responsible miners, we can provide some opportunity for the orangutan in terms of funding.вЂќ

But many scientists disagree, saying the expansion of the mine could push the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans to extinction in a few generations. Even removing just 1% of the population a year would ultimately end in extinction, they say, as orangutans only reproduce every six to nine years.

вЂњIt doesnвЂ™t take much вЂ“ especially if you start killing orangutan females вЂ“ for the population to go extinct,вЂќ says the biological anthropologist Erik Meijaard, director of the scientific consultancy Borneo Futures and one of the first experts to describe the species.

Concerns about Jardine MathesonвЂ™s decision to move ahead with expanding the mine вЂ“ without an agreed plan in place to reduce impacts to the Tapanulis вЂ“ have spread beyond the scientific community. Last year,В NorwayвЂ™s $1.6tn sovereign wealth fund sold its holdings in three Jardines firms, citing concerns about the company being responsible for вЂњsevere environmental damageвЂќ.

Tapanulis, with their frizzy, cinnamon hair and wide faces, are not only the rarest orangutan, but represent the oldest lineage of all orangutan species вЂ“ descendants of the first ancestral orangutans that arrived in Sumatra from mainland Asia more than 3m years ago.

In Batang Toru, the final holdouts of the species dwell in just three populations вЂ“ the west block, east block and Sibual-buali reserve вЂ“ spread across a patch of mountainous forest roughly the size of Rio de Janeiro. (Earlier this year, scientists confirmed they had found a small, isolated cluster of Tapanulis living in aВ peat swampВ about 32km (20 miles) outside Batang Toru.)

вЂњWe assume [the Tapanuli] was really widespread a couple of hundred years ago,вЂќ says Meijaard. But unsustainable hunting and fragmenting of the forest drove the last of the species to seek refuge in the higher elevations of Batang Toru.

Even before the proposed mine expansion, the Tapanuli was threatened by development. AВ Chinese-owned hydroelectricВ project is being built on the Batang Toru River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the ecosystem. The dam would affect an area that contains the highest density of Tapanuli orangutans вЂ“ about 42 individuals вЂ“ according to oneВ 2019 assessmentВ in the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology.

The expansion of the Martabe mine represents another blow, squeezing the apes from another side. вЂњThe Tapanuli orangutan really cannot afford any losses,вЂќ Meijaard says.

The Martabe mine was established in 2008, near the western block of Batang Toru where an estimated 533 Tapanulis are thought to live. The mineвЂ™s footprint spans about 650 hectares (1,600 acres), with 2В hectaresВ falling within the Batang Toru ecosystemвЂ™s вЂњkey biodiversity areaвЂќ, as designated by conservation NGOs in the Alliance for Zero Extinction.

PT Agincourt says it will expand the mine by about 250 hectares (617 acres) by the end of MartabeвЂ™s operational lifespan in 2034, building not only the new pit and access roads, but a large tailings-management facility. This growth includes clearing another 48 hectares of mostly primary forest in the key biodiversity area. But the company says it is also setting aside a 2,000-hectare conservation zone within its concession, as well as creating another вЂњoffsetвЂќ protected area about 40km from the mine site.

вЂњWithout the [mining] revenue from this small area, it will be very hard to carry out the conservation work and the restoration work that is planned,вЂќ says Christopher Broadbent, a UK-based sustainability consultant to PT Agincourt. вЂњIf the mine were to walk away, the unintended consequences would be almost certainly disastrous for the orangutan.вЂќ

PT Agincourt estimates its mineвЂ™s expansion will directly or indirectly affect between six and 12 orangutans. Tanio says: вЂњThroughout our 13 years of operation, there have been no cases of fatality of orangutan directly from the mining activities.

вЂњThe notion the mine can kill an orangutan directly has proven to be quite false.вЂќ

But studies show that even indirect effects can take a toll. Female orangutans are particularly sensitive to habitat loss, as they tendВ not to moveВ when they lose parts of their home range, leaving them at risk of starvation. PT Agincourt says land clearing will proceed slowly, allowing time for the orangutans to move out of the way.

вЂњWe donвЂ™t know enough to be able to say that every orangutan that moves will find some new forest to call home,вЂќ says Phil Aikman, a campaign director at Mighty Earth. Some studies suggest that pushing orangutan groups closer together will lead to social tensions and conflicts. вЂњThe big concern here is that mitigation may or may not work.вЂќ

For the past five years, environmental advocates as well as the International Union forВ ConservationВ of Nature (IUCN), have pushed to delay new construction until a mutually agreed plan is in place to protect the Tapanuli. For a time, Jardine Matheson voluntarily agreed to a moratorium on construction, engaging with the IUCNвЂ™s Avoid, Reduce, Restore and Conserve (ARRC) taskforce, which advises companies on how to avoid ape habitats and reduce impacts. But that agreement expired in December 2022.

The primatologist Genevieve Campbell, who leads the taskforce, says Jardine Matheson had made it impossible to proceed as they were unable to share raw data, including orangutan survey data within the mining permit. Jardines says the Indonesian government prevented the company from sharing that information.

But that relationship has improved in recent weeks. In November, PT Agincourt Resources signed a new conditional memorandum of understanding with the ARRC taskforce, allowing their scientists to provide independent input on the mineвЂ™s development plans and mitigation strategy.

PT Agincourt told the Guardian it would temporarily pause road construction for three weeks to allow the IUCN to complete its review. The planned protection zones, as well as a new orangutan research centre funded by the mine mean the вЂњTapanuli will be better off with the mineвЂќ, Tanio says.

Campbell disagrees that the mineвЂ™s overall impact will be positive for the Tapanuli. вЂњYou cannot say that any great ape species is better with mining than without.вЂќ

For Meijaard, little can truly compensate for the mineвЂ™s effects on the orangutans.

вЂњYou can plant 10,000 hectares of forest with lots of fruiting trees вЂ¦ so the orangutans potentially have somewhere to go. You can push them fast or you can push them slow. But youвЂ™re still pushing them into competition with other orangutans in an area that is, ecologically, quite restrained for the species.вЂќ

вЂњIf we really want to protect the species, we have to aim for zero losses,вЂќ he says.

Nigerian troops held in Burkina Faso after вЂunfriendlyвЂ™ emergency landing
Eleven Nigerian military personnel are being held in Burkina Faso after a Nigerian plane reportedly entered BurkinabГ© airspace without authorisation on Monday, the latest twist in a region enmeshed in multiple political and security crises.

In a statement on Monday evening, the breakaway Alliance of Sahel States (AES), of which Burkina Faso is a member alongside Mali and Niger, said the C-130 transport aircraft had made an emergency landing in Bobo Dioulasso.

In the statement, Assimi Goita, the Malian junta president and leader of the AES, called the landing an вЂњunfriendly act carried out in defiance of international lawвЂќ. He directed the authorities in the member countries to act вЂњto neutralise any aircraft that would violate the confederal spaceвЂќ in future.

On Monday, Nigerian authorities said the aircraft had been en route to Portugal for a ferry mission before вЂњa technical concern which necessitated a precautionary landingвЂќ.

вЂњ[The] crew is safe and have received cordial treatment from the host authorities,вЂќ said Ehimen Ejodame, the Nigerian air force spokesperson who signed the statement. вЂњPlans are ongoing to resume the mission as scheduled.вЂќ

The incident unfolded less than 24 hours after Nigeria took part in an intervention in Benin, Burkina FasoвЂ™s south-eastern neighbour, after a group of soldiers seized control of the national television station in Cotonou and announced the ousting of the president, Patrice Talon.

Authorities in Benin later said they had foiled the coup attempt and restored order, preventing what would have been the eighth successful coup in west Africa in five years.

A statement from the Nigerian government said its airstrikes вЂ“targeting a military base in Cotonou where some of the coup planners were reportedly holed up вЂ“ happened at the behest of Talon and were in compliance with the protocols of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Ivorian aircraft were also seen hovering over Beninese airspace during the crisis, pointing to a coordinated response by countries aligned with the regional bloc.

The states that make up the AES broke away from Ecowas, headquartered in Nigeria, after Ecowas threatened military intervention in Niger in 2023 to reinstate the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, after he was ousted in a coup. The AES states accuse Ecowas of breaching territorial integrity and being a puppet of the west and have also drawn closer to Russia.

Science journal retracts study on safety of MonsantoвЂ™s Roundup: вЂSerious ethical concernsвЂ™
The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology has formally retracted a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for MonsantoвЂ™s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate donвЂ™t cause cancer.

Martin van den Berg, the journalвЂ™s editor in chief, said in a note accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of вЂњserious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presentedвЂќ.

The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that MonsantoвЂ™s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans вЂ“ no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.

Regulators around the world have cited the paper as evidence of the safety of glyphosate herbicides, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in this assessment.

The listed authors of the paper, Gary Williams, Robert Kroes and Ian Munro, were scientists who did not work for Monsanto, and the study was held up by the company as a defense against conflicting scientific evidence linking Roundup to cancer. The fact that it was authored by scientists from outside the company, from seemingly independent researchers, gave it added validity.

But over the last decade, internal company documents, that came to light in litigation brought by plaintiffs in the US suffering from cancer, revealed MonsantoвЂ™s influence on the paper. The documents included an email from a company official discussing the research paper and praising the вЂњhard workвЂќ of several Monsanto scientists as part of a strategy Monsanto called вЂњFreedom to OperateвЂќ (FTO).

The corporate files showed how company officials celebrated when the paper was published.

In one email following the April 2000 publication of the Williams paper, Lisa Drake, then Monsanto government affairs official, described the toll the work of developing вЂњindependentвЂќ research papers took on multiple Monsanto employees.

вЂњThe publication by independent experts of the most exhaustive and detailed scientific assessment ever written on glyphosate вЂ¦ was due to the perseverance, hard work and dedication of the following group of folks,вЂќ Drake wrote. She then listed seven Monsanto employees. The group was applauded for вЂњtheir hard work over three years of data collection, writing, review and relationship building with the papersвЂ™ authorsвЂќ.

Drake further emphasized why the Williams paper was so significant for MonsantoвЂ™s business plans: вЂњThis human health publication on Roundup herbicide and its companion publication on ecotox and environmental fate will be undoubtedly be [sic] regarded as вЂtheвЂ™ reference on Roundup and glyphosate safety,вЂќ she wrote in the email dated 25 May 2000.

вЂњOur plan is now to utilize it both in the defense of Roundup and Roundup Ready crops worldwide and in our ability to competitively differentiate ourselves from generics.вЂќ

In a separate email, a company executive asked if Roundup logo polo shirts could be given to eight people who worked on the research papers as a вЂњtoken of appreciation for a job well doneвЂќ.

MonsantoвЂ™s Hugh Grant, who at that time was a senior executive on his way toward being named CEO and chairman, added his own praise, writing in an email: вЂњThis is very good work, well done to the team, please keep me in the loop as you build the PR info to go with it.вЂќ

In 2015, William Heydens, a Monsanto scientist, suggested that he and colleagues вЂњghost-writeвЂќ another scientific paper. Monsanto could pay outside scientists to вЂњedit & sign their namesвЂќ to the work that he and others would do, Heydens wrote in an email. вЂњRecall that is how we handled Williams Kroes and Munro 2000.вЂќ

The emails were spotlighted in jury trials in which plaintiffs suffering from cancer won billions of dollars in damages from Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018.

Gary Williams, one of the authors of the now retracted 2000 research paper, could not immediately be reached for comment. In 2017, WilliamsвЂ™s former employer New York Medical School said it found вЂњno evidenceвЂќ that a faculty member violated the schoolвЂ™s prohibition against authoring a paper ghostwritten by employees of Monsanto. The two other authors of the paper, Robert Kroes and Ian Munro, are deceased.

In explaining the decision to retract the 25-year-old research paper, Van den Berg wrote: вЂњConcerns were raised regarding the authorship of this paper, validity of the research findings in the context of misrepresentation of the contributions by the authors and the study sponsor and potential conflicts of interest of the authors.вЂќ

He noted that the paperвЂ™s conclusions regarding the carcinogenicity of glyphosate were solely based on unpublished studies from Monsanto, ignoring other outside, published research.

Van den Berg did not respond to a request for comment.

When asked about the retraction, Bayer said in a statement that MonsantoвЂ™s involvement was adequately noted in the acknowledgments section of the paper in question, including a statement that referred to вЂњkey personnel at Monsanto who provided scientific supportвЂќ. The company said the vast majority of thousands of published studies on glyphosate had no Monsanto involvement.

вЂњThe consensus among regulatory bodies worldwide that have conducted their own independent assessments based on the weight of evidence is that glyphosate can be used safely as directed and is not carcinogenic,вЂќ the company said.

An EPA spokesperson said that the agency was aware of the retraction but вЂњhas never relied on this specific article in developing any of its regulatory conclusions on glyphosateвЂќ.

The spokesperson said the EPA has вЂњextensively studied glyphosate, reviewing more than 6,000 studies across all disciplines, including human and environmental health, in developing its regulatory conclusionsвЂќ.

The updated human health risk assessment the agency is currently conducting for glyphosate is вЂњusing gold standard scienceвЂќ, the spokesman said. That assessment should be released for public comment in 2026 and will not rely on the retracted article.

вЂњThe retraction of this study is a long time coming,вЂќ said Brent Wisner, one of the lead lawyers in the Roundup litigation and a key player in getting the internal documents revealed to the public.

Wisner said the Williams, Kroes and Munro study was the вЂњquintessential example of how companies like Monsanto could fundamentally undermine the peer-review process through ghostwriting, cherrypicking unpublished studies, and biased interpretationsвЂќ.

вЂњThis garbage ghostwritten study finally got the fate it deserved,вЂќ Wisner said. вЂњHopefully, journals will now be more vigilant in protecting the impartiality of science on which so many people depend.вЂќ

News of the retraction of the study came in the same week the Trump administration urged the US supreme court to take up BayerвЂ™s bid to curtail thousands of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer.

In a brief filed at the court, the solicitor general, D John Sauer, said the company was correct that the federal law governing pesticides pre-empts lawsuits that make failure-to-warn claims over the products under state law.

Plaintiffs have said they developed non-HodgkinвЂ™s lymphoma and other forms of cancer due to using Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides sold by the company, either at home or on the job.

вЂThe Chinese will not pauseвЂ™: Volvo and Polestar bosses urge EU to stick to 2035 petrol car ban
As the battle lines harden amid GermanyвЂ™s intensifying pressure on the European Commission to scrap the 2035 ban on production of new petrol and diesel cars, two Swedish car companies, Volvo and Polestar, are leading the campaign to persuade Brussels to stick to the date.

They argue such a move is a desperate attempt to paper over the cracks in the German car industry, adding that it will not just prolong take up of electric vehicles but inadvertently hand the advantage to China.

вЂњPausing 2035 is just a bad, bad idea. I have no other words for that,вЂќ says German-born Michael Lohscheller, the chief executive of Polestar, EuropeвЂ™s only all-electric car manufacturer.

вЂњIf Europe doesnвЂ™t take the lead in this transformation, be rest assured, other countries will do it for us.вЂќ

The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has called on the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to soften the 2035 cutoff date. He has asked her to permit the manufacture of new hybrid and highly efficient combustion engine cars beyond 2035 as consumers are still hesitant to buy EVs.

вЂњWeвЂ™re sending the right signal to the commission with this letter,вЂќ Merz said, adding that the German government wanted to protect the climate in вЂњa technology-neutral wayвЂќ.

Sitting in PolestarвЂ™s glass panelled offices in Gothenburg in Sweden, Lohscheller, cannot believe what is unfolding.

His attempts to take part in the EUвЂ™s year-old вЂњstrategic dialogueвЂќ on the future of the car industry were snubbed. вЂњI wrote twice, IвЂ™m not even sure we got an answer to the second letter,вЂќ he says.

Across the road in Gothenburg, high above the giant Volvo assembly plant, HГҐkan Samuelsson, the 74-year-old chief executive of Volvo Cars, has seen it all.

вЂњI donвЂ™t see the logic in slowing down,вЂќ he says.

Samuelsson likens the resistance mounted by the multibillion car industry to the opposition to catalytic convertors, and to seatbelts 50 years ago.

вЂњIf they were not mandatory, we would probably have 30% of our cars without seatbelts and if you consider the additional cost we probably wouldnвЂ™t have any cars with catalytic converters either unless they were mandatory,вЂќ he says.

Volkswagen and BMW, Samuelsson says, вЂњcan do with they likeвЂќ, but if they take the foot off the electrification pedal, they will just widen the gap for China.

вЂњThe Chinese will set up factories in Hungary and Slovakia, Romania вЂ¦ in low labour cost markets. I donвЂ™t think itвЂ™s possible to keep them out of the EU with tariffs. You just need to meet them face on and compete with them,вЂќ he says.

Samuelsson says there is no need for von der Leyen to make a decision now and should delay it until closer to the cutoff date. вЂњWe have time. We have 10 years.вЂќ

Michael Bloss, the GreenвЂ™s rapporteur at the European parliament, says MerzвЂ™s demands вЂњwould completely gutвЂќ hard-fought EU legislation and вЂњeffectively give the combustion engine a free passвЂќ.

The Greens and the Swedes are adamant that prolonging hybrid cars will send a message to consumers that they do not need to buy electric and will be self-fulfilling for the car industryвЂ™s arguments.

Lohscheller is equally direct. вЂњThe Chinese will not pause. They will take over. If Brussels pauses this [target] and says: вЂStop we will give you another five years,вЂ™ they are really putting hundreds and thousands of jobs at risk.вЂќ

Michael Lohscheller, chief executive at Polestar.

The fast-talking, marathon-running executive says the very notion of scrubbing out the 2035 date, agreed only three years ago, is preposterous.

Lohscheller was part of the original talks that led to the EU decision in 2022 to phase out the sale of all new internal-combustion engines in 2035, hailed by the then EU vice-president Frans Timmermans as a major step towards carbon neutrality in 2050.

вЂњWhen I was CEO of Opel, I took part in all these meetings and went to Brussels twice a year. We discussed it for hours and hours,вЂќ the Polestar boss says.

вЂњI am a marathon runner. IвЂ™ve run 126 marathons in my life. Do I train and say itвЂ™s difficult, so IвЂ™ll do a half marathon instead? No.вЂќ

With decades of experience behind him as the former chief financial officer of VW, and the former chief executive of Opel and the Vietnamese car company Vinfast, Lohscheller says Germany, which is in the throes of economic challenges, needs to learn to adapt. And fast.

вЂњIt is a mindset, an attitude. I was just in China and Korea last week and came back to Germany, my home country.

вЂњIt is so obvious in Germany that everyone wants to defend the past, they donвЂ™t want to change anything, just defend what they have. I can talk with authority because I am German. In China and the US is it like вЂwhat is the next idea? What is the next project? What is the next company we try out? That is a big difference. It is a completely different mindset.вЂќ

Polestar, which began as a racing car company in 1996, was bought by Volvo in 2015 and then spun off in 2017 and relaunched as a separate EV-only production company. It is now majority owned by the Chinese Volvo shareholder Geely.

Asked whether the Chinese ownership may make Brussels nervous of VolvoвЂ™s view, Samuelsson says that Volvo is still a Swedish company. вЂњWe were with Ford for 11 years and now 14 or 15 with Geely and been developing very positively. We are listed in the Swedish stock exchange and all rules we follow are European. We are Swedish. We are no more Chinese than we were American. We are as Swedish as Abba and Ikea. вЂњ

He says the EU must continue to speed ahead on electrification. It is the future. Polestar have a car that has driven 560 miles (900km) without being charged.

Samuelsson says Volvo, which has five all-electric cars, and is about to launch the EX60, an electric version of its bestseller, XC60, already offers ranges of 310-370 miles.

This ticks one of the three big consumer concerns buying EVs, says Samuelsson. The second is charging time. This has to be down to 15-20 minutes, вЂњthe same time as the biological pause a driver needsвЂќ at the motorway stop, to get a coffee, go to the bathroom and stretch their legs. This he said will be вЂњno problemвЂќ in the future.

вЂњThe third thing which holds consumers back is the price,вЂќ he continues.

вЂњ[If] we the car industry fulfil these three I think it [EV take up] will speed up. So I really donвЂ™t see a reason today to start questioning if 2035 is too fast. We have time. We need to speed this up not slow down.вЂќ

Samuelsson also wonders about the value of constant talk about net zero that is not backed up by development on the ground.

вЂњListening to these Cop discussions in Brazil, you start wondering if all this discussion leads to an improvement of the climate or not?

вЂњIвЂ™m more and more leaning to the view that it is technical development and innovations that are needed to do the job. Talking will not do the job.

вЂњElectrification will do the job. It is good for the climate. It is really important. It is also good for customers. ItвЂ™s one of the very few environmentally friendly innovations that customers also will love.вЂќ

Labour backs plans for ВЈ15m fund to distribute surplus food from farms

Labour ministers have backed plans for a ВЈ15m fund to redistribute food from farms that otherwise go to waste, particularly around Christmas. Grants starting from ВЈ20,000 will be handed to the not-for-profit food redistribution sector in England to repackage farm food and deliver it to homeless shelters, food banks and charities. The pledge was first made by Michael Gove in 2018 and again by Rishi Sunak in 2024, but was never set up despite years of campaigning by charities. In an open letter this autumn, hundreds of charities and chef Tom Kerridge called on the Labour government to revive the plan and commit the funds in its budget. About 330,000 tonnes of edible food are thrown away by farms or fed to animals each year. Charities say they often lack the means to collect and deliver food, including festive favourites such as brussels sprouts and potatoes, to those in need. Under the government scheme, food distribution charities in England will be able to apply for grants starting from ВЈ20,000. They can use the funds to buy equipment to collect and process bulky food items, technology to help farms and charities work together and IT training for staff. Mary Creagh, minister for the circular economy, said: вЂњWith families gathering to celebrate Christmas and the new year, itвЂ™s important to remember those in our communities who may be going hungry this festive period. вЂњNobody wants to see good food go to waste вЂ“ especially farmers who work hard to put food on family tables across the country. Our new fund will help the charitable sector to work more closely with farmers, helping to find new opportunities to get their world-leading produce to those most in need within our communities.вЂќ In a joint statement the chief executive of two food redistribution charities, Charlotte Hill of the Felix Project, and Kris Gibbon-Walsh of FareShare, said: вЂњAfter years of campaigning by food redistribution charities, we are thrilled to see this fund come to fruition. We are pleased that the government has recognised that too much food goes to waste on our farms, and that it should be redistributed to feed people who need it.вЂќ Harriet Lamb, chief executive of the global environmental NGO Wrap, said the announcement вЂњgives a flying start to the new year, ensuring that food charities and the farming sector can both make a difference immediately and can develop long-term solutions. Every year, the amount of surplus food being redistributed is going up, but sadly the need is also increasing.вЂќ More information about the fund and its eligibility criteria will be announced in the new year. The government has formed a вЂњcircular economy taskforceвЂќ that will publish a strategy next year on how different sectors in England can reduce waste. The government wants to halve food waste by 2030.

Chemtrail conspiracy theories: why RFK Jr is watching the skies

A conspiracy theory that airplanes are leaving nefarious вЂњchemtrailsвЂќ in their wake due to a sinister government plot has been given fresh impetus in the US amid a swirl of concerns and confusion about proposals to geoengineer a response to the climate crisis. State legislation to ban what some lawmakers call chemtrails has been pushed forward in Tennessee and, most recently, Florida. Meanwhile, Robert F Kennedy, who has expressed interest in the conspiracy theory on social media and his podcast, is set to be at the heart of Donald TrumpвЂ™s new administration following his nomination as health secretary. вЂњWe are going to stop this crime,вЂќ Kennedy, who is known for his contrarian stances on vaccines and offshore wind farms, wrote about chemtrails on X in August. The former Democrat turned Trump ally said on his podcast last year that it was вЂњkind of frightening to think that somebody may be putting large amounts of bioavailable aluminum into the environment, spraying it in microscopic particulates from airplanesвЂќ. Believers of the chemtrails conspiracy theory contend that the white lines traced in the sky behind aircraft contain toxic chemicals that are released to achieve a devious end, such as mass sterilization or mind control. This theory, which has no evidence to support it, has been put forward at various times since the 1990s despite being repeatedly debunked. Now, scientists are faced with a resurgent focus on chemtrails amid a related, more substantive, debate over whether actual modifications to the EarthвЂ™s atmosphere should be made in a desperate attempt to slow global heating. Interest in chemtrails вЂњbubbles up every once in a while and the hurricanes and weather modification kind of brings it up to the floor againвЂќ, said David Fahey, director of the chemical sciences laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), in reference to two recent major hurricanes вЂ“ Helene and Milton вЂ“ that some figures, including Republicans, claimed were somehow steered by the federal governmentвЂ™s meddling with the weather. вЂњThe misinformation is abundant,вЂќ said Fahey, who has spent several decades, on and off, fielding questions about chemtrails. There was no orchestrated weather modification conducted by Noaa, Fahey said, and even experimenting with such a thing would be a вЂњbig step for our agency and one that we are not quite prepared to do at the moment, and maybe our agency shouldnвЂ™t do itвЂќ. Are chemtrails real? No. The white plumes seen from the rear of aircraft are more aptly called condensation trails, or contrails. They are essentially condensed water vapor from a planeвЂ™s exhaust that, in cold air temperatures at high altitudes, form as ice crystals that look like visible clouds. A survey of leading atmospheric scientists in 2016 found there was no evidence of a secret spraying program that would form these contrails. This research led to backlash from conspiracy theorists, with Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist who led the study, saying that he received death threats. вЂњI felt like it was a risk to my personal safety,вЂќ he said. вЂњPeople have bought into this false narrative. WeвЂ™re now seeing a worrying resurgence of conspiracy theories in general, from chemtrails to vaccines. ThereвЂ™s a detachment from facts and rational analysis.вЂќ In fact, contrails do contribute to a form of вЂњweather modificationвЂќ вЂ“ just not the sort envisioned by the conspiracy-minded. The plumes often grow into hazy cirrus clouds that trap heat and add to the greenhouse effect that is warming up the world, mostly via the burning of fossil fuels. вЂњAs with many conspiracy theories, there is some truth to it in that aircraft are releasing particles and affecting the EarthвЂ™s climate system,вЂќ said Caldeira, who is involved in an effort to get airlines to reduce their contrail output. вЂњBut this is because of unintended consequences of the fossil fuel airline system, rather than some nefarious secret reason.вЂќ Are any other weather modifications being conducted? There is a confusing stew of different processes, or just theories, with different goals that have been variously called weather modification, solar geoengineering or solar radiation management. These often get mixed up and mistaken for secret government conspiracies. Cloud seeding, for example, involves dispersing tiny particles into clouds to spur the formation of ice crystals that trigger rain or snow. Utah routinely does this to increase snowfall rates and authorities there have had to point out that this is not connected to chemtrails. A separate debate has stirred in recent years as to whether governments, or even wealthy individuals, should intervene to slow dangerous global heating by spraying reflective substances such as sulphur into the stratosphere in order to deflect sunlight from further warming the Earth. Noaa is setting up a system to monitor the stratosphere that could act as an вЂњearly warningвЂќ system for such activities. A US startup has offered вЂњcreditsвЂќ for people to buy in order to help cool the worldвЂ™s fever but as yet there has been no activity detected on a significant scale that would alter the climate. вЂњThere are some demonstration projects,вЂќ said Fahey. вЂњBut in terms of large-scale airplanes taking material to the stratosphere, IвЂ™m not aware of anything, certainly in our country.вЂќ Can solar geoengineering help solve the climate crisis? This year is set to be the hottest ever recorded globally, the latest in a string of hot years that are pushing the average temperature to the point it looks certain to breach the internationally agreed threshold designed to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other worsening climatic disasters. The failure of governments to stem this crisis has led to calls for more drastic interventions, like solar geoengineering, to curb the global temperature rise. Last year, the White House released a congressionally mandated report on how a research program into solar geoengineering would work. Such plans are highly controversial, however, with some scientists and environmental groups warning that meddling with the EarthвЂ™s thermostat could have unintended consequences such as altering monsoon seasons. There are also concerns about the lack of global governance around adding substances to our shared atmosphere, the potential for a huge temperature whiplash should the continual addition of sulphur via planes stop for any reason and the danger that geoengineering would distract from the primary task of cutting planet-heating emissions. Efforts by some researchers to run experiments on solar modification have been met with protests. As the world continues to heat up, though, the conversation around solar geoengineering, and related conspiracies, is unlikely to abate. вЂњI think itвЂ™s increasingly on the agenda of people who are wondering where is our climate going and how might we influence where itвЂ™s going,вЂќ said Fahey.

Dirty water, sentient trees and hope in a climate crisis: 10 environmental long reads to digest over Christmas

This year the Guardian Long Read series celebrates its 10th anniversary. Since we launched in 2014, weвЂ™ve run more than 1,000 pieces, on everything from Algerian sheep fighting to the trials and tribulations of DurexвЂ™s chief condom guy. Over the years, weвЂ™ve also run plenty of great environment stories, and for this special edition of Down to Earth we want to highlight a few of our favourites from the archive. Below weвЂ™ve picked 10 of our favourite climate pieces to dig into over the Christmas break вЂ“ but first, this weekвЂ™s most important reads. Essential reads CO2 emissions from new North Sea drilling sites would match 30 yearsвЂ™ worth from UK households Ghosts of the landscape: how folklore and songs are a key to rewilding FinlandвЂ™s reindeer вЂYou wonвЂ™t find the real criminals hereвЂ™: a Just Stop Oil activist in jail at Christmas In focus Mother trees and socialist forests: is the вЂњwood-wide webвЂќ a fantasy? In his essay, Daniel Immerwahr describes a new tree discourse, which sees them not as inert objects but intelligent subjects. Trees have thoughts and desires, the new theory goes, and they converse via fungi that connect their roots like fibre optic internet cables. Immerwahr identifies the source of this revelation as forest ecologist Suzanne Simard, whose idea of trees as intelligent and cooperative, even maternal, was so enthusiastically adopted in scientific books and popular culture. He goes on to show how this view, however romantic, is limited, and how SimardвЂ™s work provoked a quick backlash. But the bigger picture is why we so badly want this world of sentient trees to be true. Read the full long read here The great abandonment: what happens to the natural world when people disappear? Over the past half-century, the global portion of people living in rural areas has decreased by almost a third. As people gravitate to the cities for work, or to escape the ravages of the climate crisis, vast areas of land are abandoned to be reclaimed by nature. We have become accustomed to reading about rewilding projects, but these are often labour intensive. In her Long read from last month, Tess McClure asks: what happens to the natural world when people disappear? In Bulgaria, she visits a village buried in vines, one of the places where monocultures have reduced natureвЂ™s capacity to fill the void. BulgariaвЂ™s emptying rural landscapes offer us the chance to see what the land looks like after humans leave. Read the full long read here How the world got hooked on palm oil Palm oil is a wondrous product: it can enhance flavours, stabilise cosmetics, soften ice-cream, fry foods without spoiling, make shampoo more bubbly. But in his 2019 story, Paul Tullis documents how the so-called miracle ingredient insinuated itself into every corner of our lives. He shows how food conglomerate Unilever switched almost overnight to using palm oil in its products as an alternative to unhealthy trans fats, and the rest of the world followed. By the time its devastating environmental impact was discovered, consumers had decided they couldnвЂ™t do without it. There is no easy solution, but by understanding how the industry works, we can identify what the cost is.

How was this allowed to happen? Had the water industry watchdog been asleep, mismanaged, corrupt? This investigation last June, by Hettie OвЂ™Brien, examines the extent to which the agency failed in its mission, and how вЂ“ and why вЂ“ it was allowed to fall into disrepair. Through interviews with insiders, OвЂ™Brien shows how this government agency was established to police environmental crimes while, at the same time, the government was вЂњkilling environmental law by stealthвЂќ.

Like most of the Pacific, its island shores are battered by storms and coastal villages are threatened by flooding. But Fiji has a plan. In her story, Lyons followed the first wholesale move of a coastal village to higher ground inland and heard about the many challenges involved. She also talked to residents of other villages in various stages of relocation, including one where male village leaders were left in charge of plans and the new houses were designed without kitchens. Read the full long read here The coalmine that ate an Indian village Another story of communities displaced, this time by industry in cahoots with government, is Ankur PaliwalвЂ™s piece from 2022. In the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, villages and ancient forest have been destroyed to create a coalmine for Adani, a massive conglomerate owned by one of richest men in the world. In a story of вЂњcrony capitalism, oligarchy вЂ¦ regulatory captureвЂќ, Paliwal investigated secretive and intimidating government ministries as well as powerful private interests to uncover the tactics used by Adani to drive villagers off the land it wants to mine. After we published this story, we were contacted by AdaniвЂ™s press office, which claimed, absurdly, that: вЂњIt is fair to say that the article by the Guardian is an attempt to challenge IndiaвЂ™s energy security.вЂќ It is no such thing вЂ“ it is a truly powerful piece of reporting by a dedicated journalist who spent more than a year trying to expose the truth. Read the full long read here The plastic-eating bacteria that could change the world In this piece, Stephen Buranyi investigates what seems to be a major breakthrough in the battle against the plastic waste engulfing our planet. Buranyi has previously written about the public outcry against plastic pollution, and here he follows the discovery of a bacteria that can break down plastics and the scientific quest to turn that discovery into an industry-wide solution. The miraculous properties of microbes have been documented in the field of health, but this new research posists an enticing question: will highly evolved microbes really deliver us from the plastic crisis?

вЂThe dead zone is realвЂ™: why US farmers are embracing wildflowers

Between two corn fields in central Iowa, Lee Tesdell walks through a corridor of native prairie grasses and wildflowers. Crickets trill as dickcissels, small brown birds with yellow chests, pop out of the dewy ground cover. вЂњThereвЂ™s a lot of life out here, and itвЂ™s one of the reasons I like it, especially in these late summer days,вЂќ Tesdell said. This is a prairie strip. Ranging from 10-40 metres (30-120ft) in width, these bands of native perennials are placed strategically in a row-crop field, often in areas with low yields and high runoff. Tesdell has three on his farm. He points out several native plants вЂ“ big bluestem, wild quinine, milkweed, common evening primrose вЂ“ that came from a 70-species seed mix he planted here six years ago. These prairie plants help improve the soil while also protecting his more fertile fields from bursts of heavy rain and severe storms, which are becoming more frequent. вЂњTo a conventional farmer, this looks like a weed patch with a few pretty flowers in it, and I admit it looks odd in the corn and soy landscape in central Iowa. But I do it for several reasons, that I think are good reasons,вЂќ he said. вЂњIвЂ™m trying to be more climate-change resilient on my farm.вЂќ Research shows that converting as little as 10% of a corn or soya bean field into a prairie strip can reduce soil erosion by 95%. Prairie strips also help reduce nutrient pollution, store excess carbon underground and provide critical habitat for pollinators and grassland birds. Thanks to federal funding through the USDAвЂ™s conservation reserve programme,theyвЂ™ve taken off in recent years. But the idea started two decades ago with Iowa State University researchers and Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge managers. Lisa Schulte Moore, a landscape ecologist and co-director of the Bioeconomy Institute at Iowa State University, who was integral to the research, knows that large patches of restored and reconstructed prairie are vital, especially for wildlife, but she argues that integrating small amounts of native habitat back into the two dominant ecosystems вЂ“ corn and soya beans вЂ“ can make a big difference. вЂњI dream of driving across Iowa [in] winter and seeing various shades of greens and yellows and oranges, rather than brown,вЂќ said Schulte Moore. In north-central Missouri, farmer Doug Doughty has been adding and expanding conservation practices, like no-till, for decades. He also has a few hundred acres of prairie enrolled in the USDAвЂ™s conservation reserve programme. This past winter, he added prairie strips, as part of a plan to tackle nutrient pollution. High levels of nitrates and phosphorus can wreak havoc on aquatic habitats and the economies that depend on them. There are also health risks for people. Nitrates in drinking water have been associated with methaemoglobinaemia or вЂњblue baby syndromeвЂќ, and cancer. вЂњNutrients are valuable and theyвЂ™re also a liability once they get out of our fields and get into streams and rivers and water supplies,вЂќ Doughty said, вЂњand taxpayers are having to pay extra now on their water bills in locations to clean up those nitrates and phosphates.вЂќ During an outreach event in the Iowa Great Lakes region, Matt Helmers uses a rainfall simulator to demonstrate runoff and erosion with different conservation practices. HeвЂ™s one of the prairie strips researchers and director of the Iowa Nutrient Research Center at Iowa State University. вЂњPrairie strips can be very effective for not only reducing surface runoff, but treating water that interacts with the root zone below the prairie strip,вЂќ Helmers said. During a big rain storm, each prairie strip in a field acts like a вЂњmini speed-bump,вЂќ said Helmers. A thick wall of stems and leaves slows down surface water, which reduces soil erosion and gives the ground more time to soak up water. Below ground, long roots anchor layers of soil while absorbing excess water, along with nitrates and phosphorus. Farmer Eric Hoien says he first heard about the conservation practice a decade ago, right around the time he was becoming more concerned about water issues in Iowa. But the final push to add 24 acres of prairie strips came from something Hoien saw in an plane above the Gulf of Mexico. вЂњI looked down and for what was probably 20 minutes, it was just like the biggest brown mud puddle IвЂ™d ever seen. And so I knew that, that stuff they say about the dead zone, from 30,000ft, was real,вЂќ Hoien said. вЂњI know where I live, and I know that the water that comes out of our lakes eventually finds its way down there through all the river systems.вЂќ Hoien says prairie strips offer other benefits close to home. Neighbours often tell him they appreciate the wildflowers and hearing the вЂњcackleвЂќ of pheasants. He also enjoys hunting in the prairie strips and spotting insects heвЂ™s never seen before. The strips are hugely beneficial for pollinator populations, which have been dropping around the world. Researchers point to a combination of habitat loss, pesticide exposure, parasites and diseases, along with warmer temperatures and more severe weather events due to climate change. вЂњIf we can help them have a place to live and something to eat, they can be better equipped to cope with those kinds of stress that theyвЂ™re inevitably going to encounter in their environments,вЂќ says Amy Toth, who is also part of the prairie strips research team and an entomology professor at Iowa State University. Research shows both the diversity of pollinator species and overall numbers are higher in prairie strips compared to field edges without native plants. And strips of native plants arenвЂ™t just good for pollinators. Researchers, including Schulte Moore, found a nearly threefold higher density of grassland birds on fields with prairie strips. She says that grassland birds have declined more than any other avian group in North America since 1970. вЂњNationally and globally, grassland biodiversity is on very steep decline, and we need to figure out how we can share our world better with all the other species that call it home as well,вЂќ she said. We know from our data that prairie strips can help with that.вЂќ Schulte Moore says a group of forward-thinking, innovative farmers and partnerships with non-profits, foundations, universities and agencies in the midwest have helped prairie strips gain traction, but then a вЂњmonumental shiftвЂќ happened with the 2018 Farm Act, when prairie strips became an official practice in the federal conservation reserve programme. Along with technical assistance, enrolled landowners get a 50% cost-share to install prairie strips, an incentive payment and annual payments for each acre taken out of production. And many conservation organisations, some state agencies and even private companies are now also trying to incentivise the use of prairie strips. вЂњVoluntary conservation has its limits, as we can see on the landscape right now,вЂќ said Omar de Kok-Mercado, the midwest lead for land and business planning at the Colorado-based non-profit Mad Agriculture, which helps farmers with financing, market connections and community building as they transition from conventional to regenerative, organic agriculture. It recently launched a three-year pilot programme with Whole Foods Market and four farms across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Montana. Schulte Moore and other researchers are also trying to develop new markets and economic incentives for prairie strips. This includes Grass2Gas, a federally funded, multi-institutional project investigating the feasibility of using prairie strip cuttings to produce renewable natural gas with anaerobic digestion. Many natural resource experts and ecologists, including Schulte Moore, say prairie strips are not a magic bullet for todayвЂ™s soil, water and biodiversity challenges. And they emphasise that we still need to reconstruct large prairie patches while protecting the rare remnants of original, unploughed prairie. In Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, less than 1% of this ancient ecosystem remains. But years of research show that prairie strips can unlock some of these benefits. вЂњWe know that we need clean water. We need to do a better job of keeping our soil in place in our fields where it can grow our crops. We know that we need to expand the home of IowaвЂ™s native biodiversity,вЂќ said Schulte Moore. вЂњMaybe prairie strips can be part of that solution.вЂќ This story was produced in partnership with Harvest Public Media, a collaboration of public media newsrooms in the midwest.

Weather tracker: Storm brings well over a metre of snow to peaks in Alps

A snowstorm developed across the Alps on Saturday 21 December due to a low-pressure system situated over the Adriatic Sea. This depression allowed relatively warm and moist air to push into the Alps, condensing and falling as snow as it met the much colder alpine air mass. Snowfall continued for several days, with well over 1 metre of snow on some peaks and significant snowfall across many ski villages. Consequently, there was a significant avalanche risk over the Christmas period. Ski resorts in Bulgaria also experienced significant snow starting on Christmas Day, which caused disruption in the mountainous west, where ski resorts had to temporarily shut down due to road closures. Towns such as Troyan, Samokov and Teteven were particularly badly affected with snowdrifts and power failures. Meanwhile, in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, heavy snowfall on Monday caused four deaths. The town of Rohru received the highest snowfall with 24cm, followed by the towns of Sangla and Shillai which received 16.5cm and 15.3cm respectively. More than 200 roads were closed across the state, with more than 1,000 vehicles stuck near the Atal tunnel in Manali, leading to a 12-hour rescue operation. Earlier this week, a low-pressure system brought heavy rain and strong winds across Fiji, causing substantial flooding. New ZealandвЂ™s meteorological agency said 130mm of rain fell within 24 hours from 3pm on Christmas Eve to 3pm on Christmas Day. River flooding was a major problem, and police advised residents to move to higher ground. Roads were damaged due to the flood water, and there is now a risk of landslides. Further rain is expected all across Fiji as another low-pressure system arrives later this week. Stormy conditions brought large swells to Santa Cruz, California this week, with estimates of the swell reaching up to 10.7 metres (35ft). The municipal wharf, which was under construction, partially collapsed, with about 45 metres of it falling into the ocean. This follows another storm the previous week, which brought wind speeds of up to 60mph to San Francisco, and a tornado that developed in Scotts Valley approximately 70 miles south of San Francisco, which tore through the town toppling trees and cars.

Chelsea flower show garden to champion BritainвЂ™s endangered rainforests

Mosses and cow parsley will feature in a Chelsea flower show garden to celebrate endangered British rainforests. Vast expanses of the UK were once temperate rainforest. But these moss-covered ancient trees and their lichen have become a rare sight due to deforestation and overgrazing. Dartmoor, for example, once covered with trees, now harbours just a few fragments of temperate rainforest. The Chelsea garden, which will be on display next May, is being designed by Zoe Claymore, who won a gold medal last year for the вЂњrenters retreatвЂќ showing how a small, shady courtyard can be turned into a wildlife haven. Her garden this year will showcase the rare habitat and be set on BritainвЂ™s west coast, one of the few places globally with the right combination of humidity, rainfall and mild temperatures to create perfect rainforest conditions. She has been inspired by the Atlantic rainforest restoration programme, spearheaded by the Wildlife Trusts and aiming to restore 1,175 hectares of rainforest across the British Isles. Lichen, an organism that thrives in the humid conditions of a temperate rainforest, will feature in the garden on the trunks and branches of birch trees. Ferns, foxgloves and an 8-metre wide, 2.4-metre tall moss wall will also feature, and it is hoped the creation will show how gardens can be used to help restore once-lost habitat to combat the nature and climate crises. вЂњIвЂ™ve felt a deep personal connection to British rainforests since my childhood, having many happy memories playing among the rocks, stream and moss boulders at my grandparentsвЂ™ house beside Lydford Gorge in Devon,вЂќ said Claymore. вЂњEarlier this year I visited Devon Wildlife TrustвЂ™s Dart Valley nature reserve, a beautiful fragment of remaining rainforest, and it felt like coming home. The opportunity to design a garden to promote and protect these special places for future generations is a great honour. Plants for me have provided such a safe, healing connection during difficult times, and I hope this garden can inspire others to find their own relationship with nature.вЂќ She will weave in plants she encountered in the Dart Valley, including hartвЂ™s tongue fern and silver birch. вЂњIвЂ™ve peppered the list with lots of mosses as I think we need to embrace this prehistoric plant community a lot more in our gardens. IвЂ™m excited to feature wildflowers such as cow parsley вЂ“ it is an unsung hero of wildlife-friendly gardening that attracts everything from orange-tip butterflies to marmalade hoverflies. The flowers here will serve as a pop of white, contrasting with foxgloves and the verdant green of the garden.вЂќ Claymore will also be demonstrating how to garden in a soil-friendly way, hoping visitors take pointers. вЂњI have designed the garden a way that is very mindful of soil conservation вЂ“ this means that no soil is left exposed, and the absolute minimum is compacted. A raised wooden boardwalk will allow the soil underneath to breathe and be covered with plant life which will help to retain nutrients and bolsters flood resilience.вЂќ And sheвЂ™ll grow all the plants without pesticides or peat compost вЂ“ two major causes of wildlife decline and water pollution in the UK. вЂњIвЂ™d urge any conscientious gardener to steer clear of these,вЂќ she said. вЂњInstead, IвЂ™d say, embrace the charm of imperfection in your garden вЂ“ like a wonky tree вЂ“ and choose plants that suit your climatic conditions. If itвЂ™s damp and dark, why not celebrate a clump of moss? It feels fabulous underfoot. Add features like ponds and focus on native plants to give wildlife a real boost.вЂќ

Country diary: The brent geese arrive like fighter pilots вЂ“ wary of danger

A flock of geese winging across an estuary in V-formation is one of the most iconic spectacles of the season, but a rare sight in Langstone and Chichester harbours. In flight, our wintering dark-bellied brents lack the military precision displayed by other species, most notably pinkвЂ‘footed and barnacle geese. Instead, they ribbon across the steely December sky in long, undulating lines or stretch out laterally in a broad front. As I walk along the shore, 200 or so brents take flight, flushed from the coastal grazing by an off-lead dog. They momentarily jink and morph as one entity, reminiscent of a starling murmuration; then, as they wheel around, heading for the mudflats, the flock starts to elongate and splinter, irregular gaps appearing as sub-flocks form. At first glance, thereвЂ™s no semblance of order, but as they pass overhead, I realise that some birds are arranging themselves into loose wedge-shaped formations. Flying in formation has aerodynamic benefits. Air displaced by the downbeat of the bird in frontвЂ™s wings creates an upwash of air for the trailing individual to ride on, reducing drag and helping them conserve energy. The lift generated by the lead goose fractionally increases for each further back in line, with those bringing up the rear gaining the greatest advantage. However, brents are our smallest goose species, so they may not benefit from the same proportional energy savings as larger waterfowl, which expend more energy in flight. The classic V-shape also makes it easier to maintain visual contact вЂ“ a key reason why military aircraft adopt this formation during operations and airshows. But brents are noisy, constantly calling to one another to communicate their position and changes in direction, altitude, speed or leadership. They also form strong familial bonds, juveniles remaining with their parents and siblings throughout their first winter, and this familiarity may enhance their ability to fly together as a cohesive unit without employing such a formal flock configuration. Nevertheless, a family party of two adults and their three offspring approaching from the west вЂ“ prime peregrine territory вЂ“ have adopted a boomerang formation. Whether fighter pilots or geese, itвЂ™s undeniably advantageous if all eyes can see forward in potentially hostile airspace. вЂў Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the GuardianвЂ™s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount

Climate crisis exposed people to extra six weeks of dangerous heat in 2024

The climate crisis caused an additional six weeks of dangerously hot days in 2024 for the average person, supercharging the fatal impact of heatwaves around the world. The effects of human-caused global heating were far worse for some people, an analysis by World Weather Attribution (WWA) and Climate Central has shown. Those in Caribbean and Pacific island states were the hardest hit. Many endured about 150 more days of dangerous heat than they would have done without global heating, almost half the year. Nearly half the worldвЂ™s countries endured at least two months of high-risk temperatures. Even in the least affected places, such as the UK, US and Australia, the carbon pollution from fossil fuel burning has led to an extra three weeks of elevated temperatures. Worsened heatwaves are the deadliest consequence of the climate emergency. An end to coal, oil and gas burning was vital to stopping the effects getting even worse, the scientists said, with 2024 forecast to be the hottest year on record with record-high carbon emissions. The researchers called for deaths from heatwaves to be reported in real time, with current data being a вЂњvery gross underestimateвЂќ because of the lack of monitoring. It is possible that uncounted millions of people have died as a result of human-caused global heating in recent decades. вЂњThe impacts of fossil fuel warming have never been clearer or more devastating than in 2024 and caused unrelenting suffering,вЂќ said Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London and the co-lead of WWA. вЂњThe floods in Spain, hurricanes in the US, drought in the Amazon, and floods across Africa are just a few examples. We know exactly what we need to do to stop things from getting worse: stop burning fossil fuels.вЂќ Joseph Giguere, a research technician at Climate Central, said: вЂњAlmost everywhere on Earth, daily temperatures hot enough to threaten human health have become more common because of climate change.вЂќ The Guardian revealed in November that the climate crisis had caused dozens of previously impossible heatwaves, as well as making hundreds of other extreme weather events more severe or more likely to happen. The new analysis identified local вЂњdangerous heat daysвЂќ by calculating the threshold temperature for the hottest 10% of days from 1991-2020. These days are associated with increased health risks. The researchers then compared the number of days exceeding this threshold in 2024 to those in a scenario without global heating to calculate how many extra hot days were caused by the climate crisis. They found the average person was exposed to a further 41 days of dangerous heat, highlighting how the climate crisis was exposing millions more people to dangerous temperatures for longer periods of the year. Indonesia, home to 280 million people, experienced 122 days of additional dangerous heat, as did Singapore and many Central American states. In the Middle East, people in Saudi Arabia endured 70 additional hot days, in a year when at least 1,300 hajj pilgrims died during extreme heat. Brazil and Bangladesh endured about 50 extra hot days, while Spain, Norway and the Balkan countries had an additional month of high temperatures. Five billion people, almost two-thirds of the global population, experienced raised temperatures made at least twice as likely by global heating on 21 July, one of the hottest days of the year. Hurricanes were also supercharged by the climate crisis in 2024. Kristina Dahl, the vice-president for science at Climate Central, said: вЂњOur analyses have shown that every Atlantic hurricane this year was made stronger by climate change, and that hurricanes Beryl and Milton, which were both category five storms, would not have reached that level were it not for climate change.вЂќ Recent WWA analysis showed that an extraordinary sequence of six typhoons in the Philippines in 30 days, which affected 13 million people, was made more likely and more severe by global heating. Julie Arrighi, the programmes director at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: вЂњAnother devastating year of extreme weather has shown that we are not well prepared for life at [the current level] of warming. In 2025, itвЂ™s crucial that every country accelerates efforts to adapt to climate change and that funds are provided by rich nations to help developing countries become more resilient.вЂќ Measures should include better early warning systems, which saved lives, and the reporting of heat deaths, the researchers said. вЂњIn most countries there is no reporting on heatwaves at all, which means the numbers we have are always a very gross underestimate,вЂќ Otto said. вЂњIf we canвЂ™t communicate convincingly that actually lots of people are dying, itвЂ™s much harder to raise awareness that heatwaves are by far the deadliest extreme events, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real gamechanger.вЂќ

National Trust records вЂalarmingвЂ™ drop in insects and seabirds at its sites

There have been alarming declines this year in some insect species including bees, butterflies, moths and wasps, while many seabirds have also been вЂњhammeredвЂќ by unstable weather patterns caused by the climate emergency, a conservation charity has said. In its annual report on the impact of the weather on flora and fauna, the National Trust highlights that numbers of bees and butterflies have вЂњcrashedвЂќ in some areas of the UK in 2024. It describes the apparent decline of birds such as the globally threatened Arctic tern as вЂњvery shockingвЂќ and mentions diseases that are striking the white-clawed crayfish and sycamores. There have been some bright spots, including a new breeding grey seal colony on the east coast of England, and the charity also recorded encouraging numbers of owls and other birds of prey, but overall the picture is grim. The trustвЂ™s head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, Ben McCarthy, said the lurch from drier conditions since the summer of 2022 and through much of 2023 to a very wet and mild 2024 вЂ“ bookended by fierce storms вЂ“ had had a вЂњdevastating impactвЂќ. вЂњThe unpredictability of the weather and blurring of the seasons is adding additional stresses to our struggling wildlife,вЂќ he said. вЂњThe overall trends are alarming.вЂќ The trust said insects had had вЂњa very poor yearвЂќ with numbers widely observed below normal, particularly during the first half of the summer as a result of the cool and wet weather. The gardens at Barrington Court in Somerset were almost bereft of butterflies until late August or the start of September. Species such as the adonis blue crashed in west Dorset, where only 92 were recorded this year in one area that is regularly monitored, compared with 552 in 2023. Butterfly numbers at the GiantвЂ™s Causeway in Northern Ireland were half of their typical level, while at the Wicken Fen national nature reserve in Cambridgeshire the total in its traditional peak week was the lowest in 15 years of recording. Not only insects were affected. There were no natterjack toadlets at Formby, compared with 60 last year. Bat numbers in roosts including Ennerdale in the Lake District were also down, most likely the result of fewer insects to feed on. Ground-nesting waders including avocet, lapwing and redshank had a poor breeding season on the east coast of England as a result of the weather, which also affected the curlew population on the Ysbyty Ifan estate in north Wales, where nine chicks did not survive their first two weeks after hatching because of exposure or starvation. In late September, around 70 white-clawed crayfish died in the River Wansbeck catchment, which runs through the Wallington estate in Northumberland. The UKвЂ™s only native freshwater crayfish has struggled to survive since the increase in numbers and range of the invasive signal crayfish. The cause of the deaths is so far unknown. Cryptostroma corticale or sooty bark disease has started to affect sycamore trees weakened by drought in 2022 in the east of the country. The fungus infects the main living tissue of the tree. Sixty have so far been felled on National Trust land. Terns suffered big losses on the Farne Islands, with numbers of common, sandwich and Arctic tern down by 70%, 66% and 51% respectively. They are the lowest numbers in modern history, with bird flu suspected to be a key factor. Sophia Jackson, an area ranger, said: вЂњThe plummet in numbers is very shocking, especially because they have recently been added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list.вЂќ McCarthy said: вЂњOur seabirds have also been hammered in recent years by a mix of climate change impacts, poor weather and bird flu.вЂќ There were some winners. Rangers at Orford Ness national nature reserve in Suffolk announced the establishment of SuffolkвЂ™s first grey seal colony. Seals have now bred there for three consecutive years and more than 130 pups were born there last winter. It has also been a decent year for raptors, with five breeding pairs of little owls recorded at Sherborne Park estate in Gloucestershire. There was good news too for CornwallвЂ™s chough population, which grew by more than 100 for the second year running. The trust highlighted examples where its conservation and restoration work had encouraging results, including the appearance of the UKвЂ™s smallest dragonfly вЂ“ the black darter вЂ“ in newly-created pools at Great Gnats Head on Dartmoor in Devon. Its climate change adviser, Keith Jones, said: вЂњAs the world continues to get hotter, this trend hides a world of extremes вЂ“ both deluge and drought and shifting patterns. The reality is now playing out in real time, impacting landscapes, nature and the places we look after.вЂќ The fabric of some National Trust properties also had a difficult year. Storm Henk caused flooding at Avebury manor in Wiltshire for the first time in three centuries at the start of the year, and Storm Darragh brought down 30 вЂњsignificant treesвЂќ at Bodnant Garden in north Wales including a вЂњmonsterвЂќ Greek fir вЂ“ Abies cephalonica вЂ“ planted about 130 years ago.

Labour backs plans for ВЈ15m fund to distribute surplus food from farms

Labour ministers have backed plans for a ВЈ15m fund to redistribute food from farms that otherwise go to waste, particularly around Christmas. Grants starting from ВЈ20,000 will be handed to the not-for-profit food redistribution sector in England to repackage farm food and deliver it to homeless shelters, food banks and charities. The pledge was first made by Michael Gove in 2018 and again by Rishi Sunak in 2024, but was never set up despite years of campaigning by charities. In an open letter this autumn, hundreds of charities and chef Tom Kerridge called on the Labour government to revive the plan and commit the funds in its budget. About 330,000 tonnes of edible food are thrown away by farms or fed to animals each year. Charities say they often lack the means to collect and deliver food, including festive favourites such as brussels sprouts and potatoes, to those in need. Under the government scheme, food distribution charities in England will be able to apply for grants starting from ВЈ20,000. They can use the funds to buy equipment to collect and process bulky food items, technology to help farms and charities work together and IT training for staff. Mary Creagh, minister for the circular economy, said: вЂњWith families gathering to celebrate Christmas and the new year, itвЂ™s important to remember those in our communities who may be going hungry this festive period. вЂњNobody wants to see good food go to waste вЂ“ especially farmers who work hard to put food on family tables across the country. Our new fund will help the charitable sector to work more closely with farmers, helping to find new opportunities to get their world-leading produce to those most in need within our communities.вЂќ In a joint statement the chief executive of two food redistribution charities, Charlotte Hill of the Felix Project, and Kris Gibbon-Walsh of FareShare, said: вЂњAfter years of campaigning by food redistribution charities, we are thrilled to see this fund come to fruition. We are pleased that the government has recognised that too much food goes to waste on our farms, and that it should be redistributed to feed people who need it.вЂќ Harriet Lamb, chief executive of the global environmental NGO Wrap, said the announcement вЂњgives a flying start to the new year, ensuring that food charities and the farming sector can both make a difference immediately and can develop long-term solutions. Every year, the amount of surplus food being redistributed is going up, but sadly the need is also increasing.вЂќ More information about the fund and its eligibility criteria will be announced in the new year. The government has formed a вЂњcircular economy taskforceвЂќ that will publish a strategy next year on how different sectors in England can reduce waste. The government wants to halve food waste by 2030.

Chemtrail conspiracy theories: why RFK Jr is watching the skies

A conspiracy theory that airplanes are leaving nefarious вЂњchemtrailsвЂќ in their wake due to a sinister government plot has been given fresh impetus in the US amid a swirl of concerns and confusion about proposals to geoengineer a response to the climate crisis. State legislation to ban what some lawmakers call chemtrails has been pushed forward in Tennessee and, most recently, Florida. Meanwhile, Robert F Kennedy, who has expressed interest in the conspiracy theory on social media and his podcast, is set to be at the heart of Donald TrumpвЂ™s new administration following his nomination as health secretary. вЂњWe are going to stop this crime,вЂќ Kennedy, who is known for his contrarian stances on vaccines and offshore wind farms, wrote about chemtrails on X in August. The former Democrat turned Trump ally said on his podcast last year that it was вЂњkind of frightening to think that somebody may be putting large amounts of bioavailable aluminum into the environment, spraying it in microscopic particulates from airplanesвЂќ. Believers of the chemtrails conspiracy theory contend that the white lines traced in the sky behind aircraft contain toxic chemicals that are released to achieve a devious end, such as mass sterilization or mind control. This theory, which has no evidence to support it, has been put forward at various times since the 1990s despite being repeatedly debunked. Now, scientists are faced with a resurgent focus on chemtrails amid a related, more substantive, debate over whether actual modifications to the EarthвЂ™s atmosphere should be made in a desperate attempt to slow global heating. Interest in chemtrails вЂњbubbles up every once in a while and the hurricanes and weather modification kind of brings it up to the floor againвЂќ, said David Fahey, director of the chemical sciences laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), in reference to two recent major hurricanes вЂ“ Helene and Milton вЂ“ that some figures, including Republicans, claimed were somehow steered by the federal governmentвЂ™s meddling with the weather. вЂњThe misinformation is abundant,вЂќ said Fahey, who has spent several decades, on and off, fielding questions about chemtrails. There was no orchestrated weather modification conducted by Noaa, Fahey said, and even experimenting with such a thing would be a вЂњbig step for our agency and one that we are not quite prepared to do at the moment, and maybe our agency shouldnвЂ™t do itвЂќ. Are chemtrails real? No. The white plumes seen from the rear of aircraft are more aptly called condensation trails, or contrails. They are essentially condensed water vapor from a planeвЂ™s exhaust that, in cold air temperatures at high altitudes, form as ice crystals that look like visible clouds. A survey of leading atmospheric scientists in 2016 found there was no evidence of a secret spraying program that would form these contrails. This research led to backlash from conspiracy theorists, with Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist who led the study, saying that he received death threats. вЂњI felt like it was a risk to my personal safety,вЂќ he said. вЂњPeople have bought into this false narrative. WeвЂ™re now seeing a worrying resurgence of conspiracy theories in general, from chemtrails to vaccines. ThereвЂ™s a detachment from facts and rational analysis.вЂќ In fact, contrails do contribute to a form of вЂњweather modificationвЂќ вЂ“ just not the sort envisioned by the conspiracy-minded. The plumes often grow into hazy cirrus clouds that trap heat and add to the greenhouse effect that is warming up the world, mostly via the burning of fossil fuels. вЂњAs with many conspiracy theories, there is some truth to it in that aircraft are releasing particles and affecting the EarthвЂ™s climate system,вЂќ said Caldeira, who is involved in an effort to get airlines to reduce their contrail output. вЂњBut this is because of unintended consequences of the fossil fuel airline system, rather than some nefarious secret reason.вЂќ Are any other weather modifications being conducted? There is a confusing stew of different processes, or just theories, with different goals that have been variously called weather modification, solar geoengineering or solar radiation management. These often get mixed up and mistaken for secret government conspiracies. Cloud seeding, for example, involves dispersing tiny particles into clouds to spur the formation of ice crystals that trigger rain or snow. Utah routinely does this to increase snowfall rates and authorities there have had to point out that this is not connected to chemtrails. A separate debate has stirred in recent years as to whether governments, or even wealthy individuals, should intervene to slow dangerous global heating by spraying reflective substances such as sulphur into the stratosphere in order to deflect sunlight from further warming the Earth. Noaa is setting up a system to monitor the stratosphere that could act as an вЂњearly warningвЂќ system for such activities. A US startup has offered вЂњcreditsвЂќ for people to buy in order to help cool the worldвЂ™s fever but as yet there has been no activity detected on a significant scale that would alter the climate. вЂњThere are some demonstration projects,вЂќ said Fahey. вЂњBut in terms of large-scale airplanes taking material to the stratosphere, IвЂ™m not aware of anything, certainly in our country.вЂќ Can solar geoengineering help solve the climate crisis? This year is set to be the hottest ever recorded globally, the latest in a string of hot years that are pushing the average temperature to the point it looks certain to breach the internationally agreed threshold designed to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other worsening climatic disasters. The failure of governments to stem this crisis has led to calls for more drastic interventions, like solar geoengineering, to curb the global temperature rise. Last year, the White House released a congressionally mandated report on how a research program into solar geoengineering would work. Such plans are highly controversial, however, with some scientists and environmental groups warning that meddling with the EarthвЂ™s thermostat could have unintended consequences such as altering monsoon seasons. There are also concerns about the lack of global governance around adding substances to our shared atmosphere, the potential for a huge temperature whiplash should the continual addition of sulphur via planes stop for any reason and the danger that geoengineering would distract from the primary task of cutting planet-heating emissions. Efforts by some researchers to run experiments on solar modification have been met with protests. As the world continues to heat up, though, the conversation around solar geoengineering, and related conspiracies, is unlikely to abate. вЂњI think itвЂ™s increasingly on the agenda of people who are wondering where is our climate going and how might we influence where itвЂ™s going,вЂќ said Fahey.

Dirty water, sentient trees and hope in a climate crisis: 10 environmental long reads to digest over Christmas

вЂThe dead zone is realвЂ™: why US farmers are embracing wildflowers

Between two corn fields in central Iowa, Lee Tesdell walks through a corridor of native prairie grasses and wildflowers. Crickets trill as dickcissels, small brown birds with yellow chests, pop out of the dewy ground cover. вЂњThereвЂ™s a lot of life out here, and itвЂ™s one of the reasons I like it, especially in these late summer days,вЂќ Tesdell said. This is a prairie strip. Ranging from 10-40 metres (30-120ft) in width, these bands of native perennials are placed strategically in a row-crop field, often in areas with low yields and high runoff. Tesdell has three on his farm. He points out several native plants вЂ“ big bluestem, wild quinine, milkweed, common evening primrose вЂ“ that came from a 70-species seed mix he planted here six years ago. These prairie plants help improve the soil while also protecting his more fertile fields from bursts of heavy rain and severe storms, which are becoming more frequent. вЂњTo a conventional farmer, this looks like a weed patch with a few pretty flowers in it, and I admit it looks odd in the corn and soy landscape in central Iowa. But I do it for several reasons, that I think are good reasons,вЂќ he said. вЂњIвЂ™m trying to be more climate-change resilient on my farm.вЂќ Research shows that converting as little as 10% of a corn or soya bean field into a prairie strip can reduce soil erosion by 95%. Prairie strips also help reduce nutrient pollution, store excess carbon underground and provide critical habitat for pollinators and grassland birds. Thanks to federal funding through the USDAвЂ™s conservation reserve programme,theyвЂ™ve taken off in recent years. But the idea started two decades ago with Iowa State University researchers and Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge managers. Lisa Schulte Moore, a landscape ecologist and co-director of the Bioeconomy Institute at Iowa State University, who was integral to the research, knows that large patches of restored and reconstructed prairie are vital, especially for wildlife, but she argues that integrating small amounts of native habitat back into the two dominant ecosystems вЂ“ corn and soya beans вЂ“ can make a big difference. вЂњI dream of driving across Iowa [in] winter and seeing various shades of greens and yellows and oranges, rather than brown,вЂќ said Schulte Moore. In north-central Missouri, farmer Doug Doughty has been adding and expanding conservation practices, like no-till, for decades. He also has a few hundred acres of prairie enrolled in the USDAвЂ™s conservation reserve programme. This past winter, he added prairie strips, as part of a plan to tackle nutrient pollution. High levels of nitrates and phosphorus can wreak havoc on aquatic habitats and the economies that depend on them. There are also health risks for people. Nitrates in drinking water have been associated with methaemoglobinaemia or вЂњblue baby syndromeвЂќ, and cancer. вЂњNutrients are valuable and theyвЂ™re also a liability once they get out of our fields and get into streams and rivers and water supplies,вЂќ Doughty said, вЂњand taxpayers are having to pay extra now on their water bills in locations to clean up those nitrates and phosphates.вЂќ During an outreach event in the Iowa Great Lakes region, Matt Helmers uses a rainfall simulator to demonstrate runoff and erosion with different conservation practices. HeвЂ™s one of the prairie strips researchers and director of the Iowa Nutrient Research Center at Iowa State University. вЂњPrairie strips can be very effective for not only reducing surface runoff, but treating water that interacts with the root zone below the prairie strip,вЂќ Helmers said. During a big rain storm, each prairie strip in a field acts like a вЂњmini speed-bump,вЂќ said Helmers. A thick wall of stems and leaves slows down surface water, which reduces soil erosion and gives the ground more time to soak up water. Below ground, long roots anchor layers of soil while absorbing excess water, along with nitrates and phosphorus. Farmer Eric Hoien says he first heard about the conservation practice a decade ago, right around the time he was becoming more concerned about water issues in Iowa. But the final push to add 24 acres of prairie strips came from something Hoien saw in an plane above the Gulf of Mexico. вЂњI looked down and for what was probably 20 minutes, it was just like the biggest brown mud puddle IвЂ™d ever seen. And so I knew that, that stuff they say about the dead zone, from 30,000ft, was real,вЂќ Hoien said. вЂњI know where I live, and I know that the water that comes out of our lakes eventually finds its way down there through all the river systems.вЂќ Hoien says prairie strips offer other benefits close to home. Neighbours often tell him they appreciate the wildflowers and hearing the вЂњcackleвЂќ of pheasants. He also enjoys hunting in the prairie strips and spotting insects heвЂ™s never seen before. The strips are hugely beneficial for pollinator populations, which have been dropping around the world. Researchers point to a combination of habitat loss, pesticide exposure, parasites and diseases, along with warmer temperatures and more severe weather events due to climate change. вЂњIf we can help them have a place to live and something to eat, they can be better equipped to cope with those kinds of stress that theyвЂ™re inevitably going to encounter in their environments,вЂќ says Amy Toth, who is also part of the prairie strips research team and an entomology professor at Iowa State University. Research shows both the diversity of pollinator species and overall numbers are higher in prairie strips compared to field edges without native plants. And strips of native plants arenвЂ™t just good for pollinators. Researchers, including Schulte Moore, found a nearly threefold higher density of grassland birds on fields with prairie strips. She says that grassland birds have declined more than any other avian group in North America since 1970. вЂњNationally and globally, grassland biodiversity is on very steep decline, and we need to figure out how we can share our world better with all the other species that call it home as well,вЂќ she said. We know from our data that prairie strips can help with that.вЂќ Schulte Moore says a group of forward-thinking, innovative farmers and partnerships with non-profits, foundations, universities and agencies in the midwest have helped prairie strips gain traction, but then a вЂњmonumental shiftвЂќ happened with the 2018 Farm Act, when prairie strips became an official practice in the federal conservation reserve programme. Along with technical assistance, enrolled landowners get a 50% cost-share to install prairie strips, an incentive payment and annual payments for each acre taken out of production. And many conservation organisations, some state agencies and even private companies are now also trying to incentivise the use of prairie strips. вЂњVoluntary conservation has its limits, as we can see on the landscape right now,вЂќ said Omar de Kok-Mercado, the midwest lead for land and business planning at the Colorado-based non-profit Mad Agriculture, which helps farmers with financing, market connections and community building as they transition from conventional to regenerative, organic agriculture. It recently launched a three-year pilot programme with Whole Foods Market and four farms across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Montana. Schulte Moore and other researchers are also trying to develop new markets and economic incentives for prairie strips. This includes Grass2Gas, a federally funded, multi-institutional project investigating the feasibility of using prairie strip cuttings to produce renewable natural gas with anaerobic digestion. Many natural resource experts and ecologists, including Schulte Moore, say prairie strips are not a magic bullet for todayвЂ™s soil, water and biodiversity challenges. And they emphasise that we still need to reconstruct large prairie patches while protecting the rare remnants of original, unploughed prairie. In Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, less than 1% of this ancient ecosystem remains. But years of research show that prairie strips can unlock some of these benefits. вЂњWe know that we need clean water. We need to do a better job of keeping our soil in place in our fields where it can grow our crops. We know that we need to expand the home of IowaвЂ™s native biodiversity,вЂќ said Schulte Moore. вЂњMaybe prairie strips can be part of that solution.вЂќ This story was produced in partnership with Harvest Public Media, a collaboration of public media newsrooms in the midwest.

Weather tracker: Storm brings well over a metre of snow to peaks in Alps

A snowstorm developed across the Alps on Saturday 21 December due to a low-pressure system situated over the Adriatic Sea. This depression allowed relatively warm and moist air to push into the Alps, condensing and falling as snow as it met the much colder alpine air mass. Snowfall continued for several days, with well over 1 metre of snow on some peaks and significant snowfall across many ski villages. Consequently, there was a significant avalanche risk over the Christmas period. Ski resorts in Bulgaria also experienced significant snow starting on Christmas Day, which caused disruption in the mountainous west, where ski resorts had to temporarily shut down due to road closures. Towns such as Troyan, Samokov and Teteven were particularly badly affected with snowdrifts and power failures. Meanwhile, in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, heavy snowfall on Monday caused four deaths. The town of Rohru received the highest snowfall with 24cm, followed by the towns of Sangla and Shillai which received 16.5cm and 15.3cm respectively. More than 200 roads were closed across the state, with more than 1,000 vehicles stuck near the Atal tunnel in Manali, leading to a 12-hour rescue operation. Earlier this week, a low-pressure system brought heavy rain and strong winds across Fiji, causing substantial flooding. New ZealandвЂ™s meteorological agency said 130mm of rain fell within 24 hours from 3pm on Christmas Eve to 3pm on Christmas Day. River flooding was a major problem, and police advised residents to move to higher ground. Roads were damaged due to the flood water, and there is now a risk of landslides. Further rain is expected all across Fiji as another low-pressure system arrives later this week. Stormy conditions brought large swells to Santa Cruz, California this week, with estimates of the swell reaching up to 10.7 metres (35ft). The municipal wharf, which was under construction, partially collapsed, with about 45 metres of it falling into the ocean. This follows another storm the previous week, which brought wind speeds of up to 60mph to San Francisco, and a tornado that developed in Scotts Valley approximately 70 miles south of San Francisco, which tore through the town toppling trees and cars.

Chelsea flower show garden to champion BritainвЂ™s endangered rainforests

Mosses and cow parsley will feature in a Chelsea flower show garden to celebrate endangered British rainforests. Vast expanses of the UK were once temperate rainforest. But these moss-covered ancient trees and their lichen have become a rare sight due to deforestation and overgrazing. Dartmoor, for example, once covered with trees, now harbours just a few fragments of temperate rainforest. The Chelsea garden, which will be on display next May, is being designed by Zoe Claymore, who won a gold medal last year for the вЂњrenters retreatвЂќ showing how a small, shady courtyard can be turned into a wildlife haven. Her garden this year will showcase the rare habitat and be set on BritainвЂ™s west coast, one of the few places globally with the right combination of humidity, rainfall and mild temperatures to create perfect rainforest conditions. She has been inspired by the Atlantic rainforest restoration programme, spearheaded by the Wildlife Trusts and aiming to restore 1,175 hectares of rainforest across the British Isles. Lichen, an organism that thrives in the humid conditions of a temperate rainforest, will feature in the garden on the trunks and branches of birch trees. Ferns, foxgloves and an 8-metre wide, 2.4-metre tall moss wall will also feature, and it is hoped the creation will show how gardens can be used to help restore once-lost habitat to combat the nature and climate crises. вЂњIвЂ™ve felt a deep personal connection to British rainforests since my childhood, having many happy memories playing among the rocks, stream and moss boulders at my grandparentsвЂ™ house beside Lydford Gorge in Devon,вЂќ said Claymore. вЂњEarlier this year I visited Devon Wildlife TrustвЂ™s Dart Valley nature reserve, a beautiful fragment of remaining rainforest, and it felt like coming home. The opportunity to design a garden to promote and protect these special places for future generations is a great honour. Plants for me have provided such a safe, healing connection during difficult times, and I hope this garden can inspire others to find their own relationship with nature.вЂќ She will weave in plants she encountered in the Dart Valley, including hartвЂ™s tongue fern and silver birch. вЂњIвЂ™ve peppered the list with lots of mosses as I think we need to embrace this prehistoric plant community a lot more in our gardens. IвЂ™m excited to feature wildflowers such as cow parsley вЂ“ it is an unsung hero of wildlife-friendly gardening that attracts everything from orange-tip butterflies to marmalade hoverflies. The flowers here will serve as a pop of white, contrasting with foxgloves and the verdant green of the garden.вЂќ Claymore will also be demonstrating how to garden in a soil-friendly way, hoping visitors take pointers. вЂњI have designed the garden a way that is very mindful of soil conservation вЂ“ this means that no soil is left exposed, and the absolute minimum is compacted. A raised wooden boardwalk will allow the soil underneath to breathe and be covered with plant life which will help to retain nutrients and bolsters flood resilience.вЂќ And sheвЂ™ll grow all the plants without pesticides or peat compost вЂ“ two major causes of wildlife decline and water pollution in the UK. вЂњIвЂ™d urge any conscientious gardener to steer clear of these,вЂќ she said. вЂњInstead, IвЂ™d say, embrace the charm of imperfection in your garden вЂ“ like a wonky tree вЂ“ and choose plants that suit your climatic conditions. If itвЂ™s damp and dark, why not celebrate a clump of moss? It feels fabulous underfoot. Add features like ponds and focus on native plants to give wildlife a real boost.вЂќ

Country diary: The brent geese arrive like fighter pilots вЂ“ wary of danger

A flock of geese winging across an estuary in V-formation is one of the most iconic spectacles of the season, but a rare sight in Langstone and Chichester harbours. In flight, our wintering dark-bellied brents lack the military precision displayed by other species, most notably pinkвЂ‘footed and barnacle geese. Instead, they ribbon across the steely December sky in long, undulating lines or stretch out laterally in a broad front. As I walk along the shore, 200 or so brents take flight, flushed from the coastal grazing by an off-lead dog. They momentarily jink and morph as one entity, reminiscent of a starling murmuration; then, as they wheel around, heading for the mudflats, the flock starts to elongate and splinter, irregular gaps appearing as sub-flocks form. At first glance, thereвЂ™s no semblance of order, but as they pass overhead, I realise that some birds are arranging themselves into loose wedge-shaped formations. Flying in formation has aerodynamic benefits. Air displaced by the downbeat of the bird in frontвЂ™s wings creates an upwash of air for the trailing individual to ride on, reducing drag and helping them conserve energy. The lift generated by the lead goose fractionally increases for each further back in line, with those bringing up the rear gaining the greatest advantage. However, brents are our smallest goose species, so they may not benefit from the same proportional energy savings as larger waterfowl, which expend more energy in flight. The classic V-shape also makes it easier to maintain visual contact вЂ“ a key reason why military aircraft adopt this formation during operations and airshows. But brents are noisy, constantly calling to one another to communicate their position and changes in direction, altitude, speed or leadership. They also form strong familial bonds, juveniles remaining with their parents and siblings throughout their first winter, and this familiarity may enhance their ability to fly together as a cohesive unit without employing such a formal flock configuration. Nevertheless, a family party of two adults and their three offspring approaching from the west вЂ“ prime peregrine territory вЂ“ have adopted a boomerang formation. Whether fighter pilots or geese, itвЂ™s undeniably advantageous if all eyes can see forward in potentially hostile airspace. вЂў Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the GuardianвЂ™s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount

Climate crisis exposed people to extra six weeks of dangerous heat in 2024

The climate crisis caused an additional six weeks of dangerously hot days in 2024 for the average person, supercharging the fatal impact of heatwaves around the world. The effects of human-caused global heating were far worse for some people, an analysis by World Weather Attribution (WWA) and Climate Central has shown. Those in Caribbean and Pacific island states were the hardest hit. Many endured about 150 more days of dangerous heat than they would have done without global heating, almost half the year. Nearly half the worldвЂ™s countries endured at least two months of high-risk temperatures. Even in the least affected places, such as the UK, US and Australia, the carbon pollution from fossil fuel burning has led to an extra three weeks of elevated temperatures. Worsened heatwaves are the deadliest consequence of the climate emergency. An end to coal, oil and gas burning was vital to stopping the effects getting even worse, the scientists said, with 2024 forecast to be the hottest year on record with record-high carbon emissions. The researchers called for deaths from heatwaves to be reported in real time, with current data being a вЂњvery gross underestimateвЂќ because of the lack of monitoring. It is possible that uncounted millions of people have died as a result of human-caused global heating in recent decades. вЂњThe impacts of fossil fuel warming have never been clearer or more devastating than in 2024 and caused unrelenting suffering,вЂќ said Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London and the co-lead of WWA. вЂњThe floods in Spain, hurricanes in the US, drought in the Amazon, and floods across Africa are just a few examples. We know exactly what we need to do to stop things from getting worse: stop burning fossil fuels.вЂќ Joseph Giguere, a research technician at Climate Central, said: вЂњAlmost everywhere on Earth, daily temperatures hot enough to threaten human health have become more common because of climate change.вЂќ The Guardian revealed in November that the climate crisis had caused dozens of previously impossible heatwaves, as well as making hundreds of other extreme weather events more severe or more likely to happen. The new analysis identified local вЂњdangerous heat daysвЂќ by calculating the threshold temperature for the hottest 10% of days from 1991-2020. These days are associated with increased health risks. The researchers then compared the number of days exceeding this threshold in 2024 to those in a scenario without global heating to calculate how many extra hot days were caused by the climate crisis. They found the average person was exposed to a further 41 days of dangerous heat, highlighting how the climate crisis was exposing millions more people to dangerous temperatures for longer periods of the year. Indonesia, home to 280 million people, experienced 122 days of additional dangerous heat, as did Singapore and many Central American states. In the Middle East, people in Saudi Arabia endured 70 additional hot days, in a year when at least 1,300 hajj pilgrims died during extreme heat. Brazil and Bangladesh endured about 50 extra hot days, while Spain, Norway and the Balkan countries had an additional month of high temperatures. Five billion people, almost two-thirds of the global population, experienced raised temperatures made at least twice as likely by global heating on 21 July, one of the hottest days of the year. Hurricanes were also supercharged by the climate crisis in 2024. Kristina Dahl, the vice-president for science at Climate Central, said: вЂњOur analyses have shown that every Atlantic hurricane this year was made stronger by climate change, and that hurricanes Beryl and Milton, which were both category five storms, would not have reached that level were it not for climate change.вЂќ Recent WWA analysis showed that an extraordinary sequence of six typhoons in the Philippines in 30 days, which affected 13 million people, was made more likely and more severe by global heating. Julie Arrighi, the programmes director at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: вЂњAnother devastating year of extreme weather has shown that we are not well prepared for life at [the current level] of warming. In 2025, itвЂ™s crucial that every country accelerates efforts to adapt to climate change and that funds are provided by rich nations to help developing countries become more resilient.вЂќ Measures should include better early warning systems, which saved lives, and the reporting of heat deaths, the researchers said. вЂњIn most countries there is no reporting on heatwaves at all, which means the numbers we have are always a very gross underestimate,вЂќ Otto said. вЂњIf we canвЂ™t communicate convincingly that actually lots of people are dying, itвЂ™s much harder to raise awareness that heatwaves are by far the deadliest extreme events, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real gamechanger.вЂќ

National Trust records вЂalarmingвЂ™ drop in insects and seabirds at its sites

There have been alarming declines this year in some insect species including bees, butterflies, moths and wasps, while many seabirds have also been вЂњhammeredвЂќ by unstable weather patterns caused by the climate emergency, a conservation charity has said. In its annual report on the impact of the weather on flora and fauna, the National Trust highlights that numbers of bees and butterflies have вЂњcrashedвЂќ in some areas of the UK in 2024. It describes the apparent decline of birds such as the globally threatened Arctic tern as вЂњvery shockingвЂќ and mentions diseases that are striking the white-clawed crayfish and sycamores. There have been some bright spots, including a new breeding grey seal colony on the east coast of England, and the charity also recorded encouraging numbers of owls and other birds of prey, but overall the picture is grim. The trustвЂ™s head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, Ben McCarthy, said the lurch from drier conditions since the summer of 2022 and through much of 2023 to a very wet and mild 2024 вЂ“ bookended by fierce storms вЂ“ had had a вЂњdevastating impactвЂќ. вЂњThe unpredictability of the weather and blurring of the seasons is adding additional stresses to our struggling wildlife,вЂќ he said. вЂњThe overall trends are alarming.вЂќ The trust said insects had had вЂњa very poor yearвЂќ with numbers widely observed below normal, particularly during the first half of the summer as a result of the cool and wet weather. The gardens at Barrington Court in Somerset were almost bereft of butterflies until late August or the start of September. Species such as the adonis blue crashed in west Dorset, where only 92 were recorded this year in one area that is regularly monitored, compared with 552 in 2023. Butterfly numbers at the GiantвЂ™s Causeway in Northern Ireland were half of their typical level, while at the Wicken Fen national nature reserve in Cambridgeshire the total in its traditional peak week was the lowest in 15 years of recording. Not only insects were affected. There were no natterjack toadlets at Formby, compared with 60 last year. Bat numbers in roosts including Ennerdale in the Lake District were also down, most likely the result of fewer insects to feed on. Ground-nesting waders including avocet, lapwing and redshank had a poor breeding season on the east coast of England as a result of the weather, which also affected the curlew population on the Ysbyty Ifan estate in north Wales, where nine chicks did not survive their first two weeks after hatching because of exposure or starvation. In late September, around 70 white-clawed crayfish died in the River Wansbeck catchment, which runs through the Wallington estate in Northumberland. The UKвЂ™s only native freshwater crayfish has struggled to survive since the increase in numbers and range of the invasive signal crayfish. The cause of the deaths is so far unknown. Cryptostroma corticale or sooty bark disease has started to affect sycamore trees weakened by drought in 2022 in the east of the country. The fungus infects the main living tissue of the tree. Sixty have so far been felled on National Trust land. Terns suffered big losses on the Farne Islands, with numbers of common, sandwich and Arctic tern down by 70%, 66% and 51% respectively. They are the lowest numbers in modern history, with bird flu suspected to be a key factor. Sophia Jackson, an area ranger, said: вЂњThe plummet in numbers is very shocking, especially because they have recently been added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list.вЂќ McCarthy said: вЂњOur seabirds have also been hammered in recent years by a mix of climate change impacts, poor weather and bird flu.вЂќ There were some winners. Rangers at Orford Ness national nature reserve in Suffolk announced the establishment of SuffolkвЂ™s first grey seal colony. Seals have now bred there for three consecutive years and more than 130 pups were born there last winter. It has also been a decent year for raptors, with five breeding pairs of little owls recorded at Sherborne Park estate in Gloucestershire. There was good news too for CornwallвЂ™s chough population, which grew by more than 100 for the second year running. The trust highlighted examples where its conservation and restoration work had encouraging results, including the appearance of the UKвЂ™s smallest dragonfly вЂ“ the black darter вЂ“ in newly-created pools at Great Gnats Head on Dartmoor in Devon. Its climate change adviser, Keith Jones, said: вЂњAs the world continues to get hotter, this trend hides a world of extremes вЂ“ both deluge and drought and shifting patterns. The reality is now playing out in real time, impacting landscapes, nature and the places we look after.вЂќ The fabric of some National Trust properties also had a difficult year. Storm Henk caused flooding at Avebury manor in Wiltshire for the first time in three centuries at the start of the year, and Storm Darragh brought down 30 вЂњsignificant treesвЂќ at Bodnant Garden in north Wales including a вЂњmonsterвЂќ Greek fir вЂ“ Abies cephalonica вЂ“ planted about 130 years ago.

A shift no country can ignore’: where global emissions stand, 10 years after the Paris climate agreement
The watershed summit in 2015 was far from perfect, but its impact so far has been significant and measurable

Ten years on from the historic Paris climate summit, which ended with the world’s first and only global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, it is easy to dwell on its failures. But the successes go less remarked.

Renewable energy smashed records last year, growing by 15% and accounting for more than 90% of all new power generation capacity. Investment in clean energy topped $2tn, outstripping that into fossil fuels by two to one.

Electric vehicles now account for about a fifth of new cars sold around the world. Low-carbon power makes up more than half of the generation capacity of China and India, with China’s emissions now flattening, and most developed countries on a downward trend.

For Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat who was one of the main architects of the Paris accord and is now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, this is a remarkable achievement. “The Paris agreement has set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore,” she said.

Would this have happened without the Paris agreement? Unlikely, according to Bill Hare, chief executive of the Climate Analytics thinktank. He said: “The 1.5C limit [for rising global temperatures] and the net zero goal have reshaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules, helping to rewire how states, markets and institutions work.”

Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, said look where temperatures were headed before Paris, if you want to judge the summit’s impact. The planet was on track for more than 4C of heating, a catastrophic increase.

After Paris, that came down to 3C. Then, after Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, which reaffirmed the 1.5C pledge, carbon-cutting commitments brought the projected temperature rise to about 2.8C. Today, the forecast stands at about 2.5C, if all existing promises are fulfilled.
“We’ve made progress as a world, but we also know that is far short of what we agreed at Paris,” said Miliband. “You’re trying to get 193 countries to agree to these big fundamental questions about the trajectory of their economies, their societies, the way their energy systems work. No wonder it’s difficult.”

Yet the shaky response to the Paris agreement from some key countries in its immediate aftermath has added significantly to the climate crisis we now face, and the failure of rich governments in more recent years to uphold their side of the bargain with the poorer world threatens to implode the global consensus.

The question now is: can countries learn from the mistakes of the past decade, in order to keep the Paris agreement alive in the next?

The history of the last 10 years in climate politics is one of glaring contradictions, forward leaps followed by backsliding, and cooperation attended by fracture. The first blow to the fledgling Paris agreement came within just a year, with the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. He vowed to withdraw from the pact, and began the process in 2017.

This year, that pattern looked set to repeat: in January, on re-entry to the White House, Trump began the withdrawal process again, while kicking off damaging global trade turmoil through the imposition of swingeing tariffs.

Though Trump’s first withdrawal did not create the “snowball” effect some had feared – no other functioning country has left since – he may also bear partial responsibility for another blow: after 2016, China vastly speeded up its rate of carbon dioxide output.

When Xi Jinping travelled to Paris in November 2015, and for a short time after, emissions from the world’s second biggest economy looked to be peaking at just under 10bn tonnes per year.

But in 2017, that dream was dashed. Coal-fired power took off again, and China’s carbon output resumed its upward march, at an accelerated pace, reaching 12.3bn tonnes last year.

Morrisons becomes first UK supermarket to delay net zero targets
Britain’s fifth-biggest grocer postpones goal by 15 years to 2050, saying revised plan will now cover entire supply chain

Morrisons has become the first UK supermarket chain to postpone its net zero carbon emission targets, delaying them by 15 years to 2050.

Britain’s fifth-biggest grocer said its new targets would cover the entire supply chain, as well as Morrisons stores, including emissions from agriculture and land-use sources.

The Bradford-based company said it had achieved a 22% reduction in total carbon emissions since 2019 – its baseline – through operational changes, energy-efficiency projects, lower-carbon logistics and collaboration with its suppliers.

Morrisons denied the changes were a watering down of its targets.

Andrew Edlin, head of sustainability at the chain, said: “The validation of these targets reaffirms Morrisons’ commitment to sustainability and the move to a 2050 target across the full value chain is a big step forward in our journey to net zero.

“We are taking upstream and downstream emissions of our operations into account, including emissions created in making products, in our stores, transport systems and then end-of-life emissions too. Additional targets for forest, land and agriculture (Flag) emissions reflect the importance of land-use and agricultural impacts across the business.”

He added that industry-wide collaboration would be essential in achieving these goals.

The government, under Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has a target of reaching net zero in the UK by 2050, with interim carbon budgets for 2030 and beyond.

Morrisons is trying to turn around its sales performance, after running up debts in a £7bn takeover by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice in 2021. The German discounter Lidl has moved closer to overtaking Morrisons as the UK’s fifth biggest supermarket chain, behind Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Aldi. Morrisons has an 8.3% share of the grocery market, while Lidl has 8.1%.

We must not stop research on solar geoengineering


Bryony Worthington says the media should not be pushing a western attitude to climate strategies to the detriment of African nations. Plus letters from Prof Hugh Hunt, Dr Portia Adade Williams and Angela Churie Kallhauge

our editorial (8 December) says that it is “hard to disagree” with calls to ban research into climate interventions or geoengineering solutions, citing well-worn tropes about a “termination shock” scenario and a dislike of private-sector involvement in the field. The pretext for forming this opinion – and claiming it represents all of Africa – appears to be the brief reference in a joint statement earlier this year from the African environmental ministers.

I can’t help feeling that the Guardian is being played. Every advance in human technology elicits cries from a vocal few that a line must be drawn that cannot be crossed. Usually seeded in the corridors of western NGOs, legitimate concerns are whipped up into fearmongering and luddism, with the goal of holding back scientific inquiry.

We saw this with genetic modification in agriculture, it’s been ever present in the anti-nuclear camp, and it’s back again – betting against human agency in the face of increasing climate impact. A lot of people want to reduce climate risks, and the range of plausible actions that could be taken to avert suffering is thankfully getting broader. This is especially important as climate impacts escalate far faster than predicted. But to evaluate new ideas requires more research – carried out responsibly and transparently.

Compared with the reckless experiment that humanity is conducting with the atmosphere, exploring if we can increase the reflectivity of the planet (which is currently dimming, stoking climate risks even further) is a tiny, temporary and reversible action that could have profoundly beneficial outcomes.

Time has shown that previous “ban science” campaigns were wrongheaded and to the detriment of countries that are most exposed to environmental risks. The morally correct action for newspapers like the Guardian is to raise awareness objectively and to allow scientific inquiry to help us out of the mess we are in.

Lead author, Climate Change Act

 Your editorial advocates the “precautionary principle” – better to do nothing than to put risky technology under Donald Trump’s control. No one is promoting solar geoengineering as a solution to global heating. It’s a stopgap that may become our only strategy if we fail to curb CO2 emissions. We are already well down the dangerous road of net zero, where we are promised that untried technologies can offset our emissions so that we can carry on with business as usual. To make a difference, these carbon dioxide removal schemes would need to draw down some 30bn tonnes of CO2 a year.

One form of solar geoengineering is to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth – solar radiation modification (SRM). Cooling of 10C can be achieved by spraying 10m tonnes of material. There are other strategies, including spraying seawater to make clouds more reflective. All these ideas are the subject of serious research, in universities around the world, that takes ethical and governance considerations seriously.

Solar geoengineering doesn’t cut greenhouse gas emissions – there is no suggestion that it should. What is clear is that the rate at which we are reducing emissions and devising methods to remove CO2 are not fast enough. SRM is, unfortunately, becoming a necessity. We cannot afford the risk of doing nothing.
Prof Hugh Hunt
Deputy director, Centre for Climate Repair, University of Cambridge

 We were dismayed by your editorial on the purported African view on solar geoengineering. The view was not reflective of the discourse that took place in the margins of UN environment assembly in Nairobi.

First, the published view conflates solar radiation modification (SRM) deployment with research. The current debate is not about embracing or rejecting SRM as a solution; it is about gaining more knowledge and widening informed dialogue that can make us better prepared for the hard choices that may lie ahead.

The issue of geoengineering is increasingly important as stakeholders seek solutions for potential worst-case scenarios against the backdrop of inadequate action and increasing impacts. We must ensure the all stakeholders have an equal seat at the table.

African and other stakeholders have the right to this information to make informed decisions for themselves. Deployment rightly raises profound concerns. But shutting down any research and dialogue – closing the very spaces where we can interrogate and contribute science, debate risks and shape objective future decisions – would diminish agency and increase vulnerability.

Your editorial’s homogeneous characterisation of the African continent, paired with this lack of fundamental understanding of the current substantive topic, exemplifies this problem and silences the range of African perspectives that do exist. This is not benign, and it is part of a broader narrative that routinely discounts scientific experts and research networks on the continent from global discussions.

Africa has contributed least to the climate crisis and stands to lose the most. African researchers are already contributing significant knowledge on climate change. We cannot afford decisions about our common future without their engagement. A more accurate and respectful discourse starts with lifting these diverse voices rather than subsuming them.

Climate crisis forecast to wipe out thousands of glaciers a year globally, threatening water supplies and cultural heritage



Glaciers in the European Alps are likely to reach their peak rate of extinction in only eight years, according to a study, with more than 100 due to melt away permanently by 2033. Glaciers in the western US and Canada are forecast to reach their peak year of loss less than a decade later, with more than 800 disappearing each year by then.

The melting of glaciers driven by human-caused global heating is one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Communities around the world have already held funeral ceremonies for lost glaciers, and a Global Glacier Casualty List records the names and histories of those that have vanished.

About 200,000 glaciers remain worldwide, with about 750 disappearing each year. However, the research indicates this pace will accelerate rapidly as emissions from burning fossil fuels continue to be released into the atmosphere.

Current climate action plans from governments are forecast to push global temperatures to about 2.7C above preindustrial levels, supercharging extreme weather. Under this scenario, glacier losses would peak at about 3,000 a year in 2040 and plateau at that rate until 2060. By the end of the century, 80% of today’s glaciers will have gone.


By contrast, rapid cuts to carbon emissions to keep global temperature rise to 1.5C would cap annual losses at about 2,000 a year in 2040, after which the rate would decline.

Previous studies have focused on the volume of ice lost, given its contribution to rising sea levels that threaten coastal towns and cities. Individual glaciers, however, are also important as water sources and tourist attractions for many communities, and often have spiritual significance for local people. This prompted the researchers to analyse the number of glaciers disappearing.

Matthias Huss, a senior scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and a member of the study team, said: “As glaciologists, we do not only model the disappearance of glaciers globally, but we are very directly concerned with this loss of glaciers in our daily work.”

As the director of the Swiss glacier monitoring network, Huss recently declared four extinct, the latest in an estimated 1,000 lost in the country over the past three decades.

Huss also spoke at a funeral ceremony for the Pizol glacier in 2019. “More than 250 people climbed up to this glacier to say goodbye. It was very impressive.”

Such funerals have also taken place in Iceland, Nepal and elsewhere. “People climb up to these vanishing glaciers to say goodbye for themselves, but also to send out a strong signal to the public to tell them it matters to us.”

Many glaciers hold spiritual significance, for example Māori culture regard them as ancestors. The Māori political leader Nā Lisa Tumahai visited the melting Kā Roimata o Hine Hukatere in 2022 and told the Global Glacier Casualty List: “This mighty glacier, a presence once so physically commanding, is shrinking into oblivion. [It] has been subdued, humiliated by the actions of humans.

“To see this retreating giant is to understand impermanence, to understand the real and terrible results of industrialisation, of climate change.”

The new study, published in Nature Climate Change, analysed more than 200,000 glaciers from a database of outlines derived from satellite images. The researchers used three global glacier models to assess their fate under different heating scenarios.

Regions with the smallest and fastest-melting glaciers were found to be the most vulnerable. The study estimates the 3,200 glaciers in central Europe would shrink by 87% by 2100 – even if global temperature rise is limited to 1.5C, rising to 97% under 2.7C of heating.

In the western US and Canada, including Alaska, about 70% of today’s 45,000 glaciers are projected to vanish under 1.5C of heating, and more than 90% under 2.7C. The Caucasus and southern Andes are also expected to face devastating losses.

Larger glaciers take longer to melt, with those in Greenland reaching their peak extinction rate in about 2063 – losing 40% by 2100 under 1.5C of heating and 59% under 2.7C. However, the melting is forecast to continue beyond 2100.

The researchers said the peak loss dates represent more than a numerical milestone. “They mark turning points with profound implications for ecosystems, water resources and cultural heritage,” they wrote. “[It is] a human story of vanishing landscapes, fading traditions and disrupted daily routines.”
These transitions also underscored the urgent need to help communities adapt to changing conditions, they said, with 2 billion people downstream reliant on mountain water for regular supplies and food security. Adaptation measures could include new types of farming, alternative businesses to replace tourism and even artificial glaciers, which have been trialled in Kyrgyzstan.

Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, a senior adviser at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and not part of the study, said: “[The study] underscores how today’s climate decisions will profoundly influence the future of these vital natural features.”

Shrestha said the work offered a valuable perspective on the rapid changes occurring in glacier landscapes and the people that depend on them, while noting some limitations, including uncertainty in counting small and debris-covered glaciers and the lack of up-to-date data.

Chances of EU trucking industry hitting zero emissions targets are dire, says industry body
Only 10,000 out of economic bloc’s 6m trucks are electric and are more likely to be operating on short routes

 
The chances of the European trucking industry hitting zero emissions targets are “dire”, an industry body has warned, as it emerged that only a tiny amount of lorries delivering goods in the EU are electric.

Speaking as the European Commission prepares to water down electric car targets, the boss of the association for commercial vehicles called on the commission to commit to an urgent review of the sector, tackling problems including a lack of public charging points, a lack of tax breaks for trucks and high energy costs.

“The situation is, in a way, dire,” said Christian Levin, the chair of the commercial vehicles board of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said.

About 6m trucks deliver goods across the EU but only 10,000 are electric and are more likely to be operating on short routes, the ACEA said.

The commercial sector now wants an audit of the market similar to the commission’s review of the car sector, with expectations it will water down targets for electric cars on Tuesday after a meeting in Strasbourg.

Levin said there were also huge financial implications for fleet managers, who faced a price tag of €300,000 (£263,000) for an electric 40-tonne two-axle truck, twice the cost of a diesel alternative.

“The main reason why customers are holding back is they just see it’s more expensive to operate with a battery electric vehicle, but they also see less flexibility and higher risk for instance [in] residual value, or [concerns] if they have to change their transport assignment, and suddenly they need to do another route where a charging is not possible,” Levin said.

Karin Rådström, the chair of the board of management at Daimler Truck, said trucking companies were willing to go electric but they worked on a 2% to 3% margin and the business case was not there unless reaching zero emissions was made more financially attractive.

Under current targets, 43% of Europe’s HGV fleet must be electric by 2030, 65% by 2035 and 90% by 2040, with fines for manufacturers who fail to meet fleet-wide CO2 targets. At the moment, fewer than 2% of new HGV registrations are electrically chargeable trucks.

“If the trajectory of uptake continues as is … the industry would pay about €2bn in yearly fines,” Levin said.

Rådström said there were only 1,500 public charging points for HGVs across Europe but there needed to be 35,000 to enable the transition to electric, or about 500 installed a month.

“I’ve been chief executive of Daimler Truck now for 14 months, and I think in total, during these 14 months, there were less than 500 built. So that just shows you the magnitude of acceleration that we need,” she said.

Last year it emerged there was only one public electric charging point for HGVs in the UK.

Sigrid de Vries, the director general of the ACEA, called on the commission to instigate an early review of the targets so there “can be a closer alignment between the enabling conditions that are not in place and are not coming online, and the obligations on the sector, including having to pay penalties”.

Weather tracker: Bushfires ravage Western Australia as temperatures soar


Extreme heat follows blazes in New South Wales, while winds plunge Brazil’s largest city into darkness

Extreme heat and bushfires have ravaged the parched landscape of Western Australia. With temperatures expected to continue soaring above 40C (104F) over the coming days, the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe heatwave warning across much of the south-west.

The conditions follow bushfires in New South Wales this month, which resulted in the destruction of homes and loss of life. Severe heatwave warnings have also been issued for later this week in parts of South Australia and New South Wales, as a ridge of high pressure moves eastward, bringing blazing sunshine to much of the region.

In Brazil, São Paulo was plunged into darkness last week after strong winds damaged the city’s power grid, with falling trees bringing down power lines. The weather conditions also caused travel disruption at Congonhas airport, where hundreds of flights were cancelled. Severe damage to electrical infrastructure is expected to cause further problems as utility companies scramble to restore power to more than 1 million residents.
Meanwhile, California’s Central Valley – known for its clear skies and abundant sunshine – has experienced one of its dullest and foggiest weeks on record. Tule fog, which typically lingers for only a few days, has been unusually widespread and persistent this year, keeping temperatures at Sacramento international airport below 8C for more than a week – the longest such streak in more than three decades. The prolonged fog has been fuelled by exceptional autumn rainfall that left soils saturated.

And in Spain, Storm Emilia has brought intense rainfall, strong winds and even snow to the Canary Islands – conditions many would not associate with the popular holiday destination. While snow is not unheard of at higher ground on Tenerife, Emilia delivered some of the deepest accumulations since 2016 to the Teide national park, forcing its closure on Sunday.

Alongside the snowfall, strong northerly winds swept across the archipelago, with gusts exceeding 50mph recorded on several islands including Lanzarote and Gran Canaria. The effect of Storm Emilia is expected to ease this week with more seasonal weather taking hold.

Tabletop tomatoes and drought-resistant roses tipped as 2026’s top garden trend.


Bouquets of cut flowers will be swapped for tabletop vegetable plants next year, the Royal Horticultural Society has said, as the UK charity announces its top plant trend predictions for 2026.

Mini-planters of aubergines, chillies, peppers and tomatoes will be displayed in homes instead of flowers, as breeders develop dwarf varieties that are decorative and capable of supplementing the weekly shop, the RHS says.

Gardeners have also been looking for drought-tolerant plants after one of the driest springs and summers on record, with much of the country under a hosepipe ban in summer. Rose growers have been crossbreeding their flowers with central Asian varieties that are adapted to arid conditions.

The charity’s predictions draw on engagement with the public across its gardens, shows and gardening advice service, as well as retail and industry trends, science research and new plant breeding.

Guy Barter, the chief horticulturalist at the RHS, said: “Small veg plants are seen by plant breeders and nurseries as an expanding market, and have developed compact cultivars supporting a good crop of quality produce that are easy to grow and have eye-appeal as fully grown plants that will give weeks of satisfaction to gardeners.
“These are offered as seeds for people to raise on their own, plug plants are available by mail order and small potted plants are offered by garden centres. Smaller vegetable plants also lend themselves to being grown in cold frames, cloches or even sunny windowsills, where greenhouse space is lacking for bigger, tender crops such as aubergines, chilies, peppers and tomatoes.”

New popular choices include tabletop chillies, compact aubergines and hanging basket cucumbers. Potted herbs also remain a firm favourite, with sales up 10% in the past year across RHS retail.

Drought-tolerant rose varieties are coming to market as green-fingered Britons adapt to climate breakdown.

Barter added: “Roses are tough and reliable shrubs but Rosa persica from central Asia, where winters are bitter and summers fiercely hot and dry, have been used by plant breeders to take rose resilience to new levels, using R persica as a source of drought and disease resistance in some new cultivars currently under trial at RHS Wisley. This year they have performed outstandingly well in the garden, relishing this summer’s extremes.”

This year they have performed outstandingly well in the garden, relishing this summer’s extremes.”

Country diary: I love these soggy winter bogs – and so do the snipe.

ays of torrential rain have yet to drain from this broad ridge at the westernmost edge of Dartmoor. The wide path to the top of Gibbet Hill, with views of Wheal Betsy, the nearby abandoned mine, is glazed with puddles, and I am forced to hop between tussocks of sedge to avoid treading ankle-deep in the liquid earth.

This is my favourite season on Dartmoor – a time when it most feels like a moor: wet, muddy, bleak, empty. The wind-bent grass and dark scuffs of peat appear devoid of life. But winter walks promise fleeting encounters with a species that always takes you by surprise: snipe.

These birds are the “stomp rockets” of boggy moorland. A heavy footstep sends them hurtling skywards like a child’s toy which, with a stamp on an inflated pad, launches a foam rocket into the air.
I never spot a snipe on the ground before it takes flight. These wary waders, perfectly camouflaged with mottled brown plumage, wait until the last moment as you approach. Then they suddenly take off, zigzagging high and uttering a rasping call, only coming back down some way away.

In his 1983 poem Snipe, the late poet laureate Ted Hughes perfectly described how, on a sodden walk, one “rips itself up from the marsh‑quake” with “bowed head, jockey shoulders” as it “slashes a wet rent” through the downpour.

Snipe only give you a second or two to work out what they are as they race off into the mist, but their most conspicuous feature is the long straight bill, like a conductor’s baton. About 75,000 pairs breed in the UK during spring and summer, with the greatest concentrations in the uplands of northern Britain. Over the colder months, visiting snipe from Europe push numbers above 1 million, and they are more widely spread.
Wetland reserves and estuaries offer the most reliable views, but nothing beats a taste of the unpredictable, venturing off the beaten track in areas damp under foot. One could wander past snipe without ever knowing, or you might get lucky and step close enough to detonate this missile of the mires – a startling explosion of life. Muddy boots and wet socks are a price well worth paying.

Country diary: The river has risen to meet the trees. This is Storm Claudia’s work

Low sunlight casts the shadows of figures, standing on the Frankwell footbridge in Shrewsbury across the River Severn, into trees. The willows have shaken loose from leafing, and the light that strikes them has a brilliance no longer absorbed by hungry foliage. The trees are illuminated, freed from the processes of growth, and the river has risen to meet them.

The shadows stand in the golden branches above a bend in the river, and look back at us. They are dark and shift slightly, mirroring our movements, but not enough to feel we are the same thing. We’re not. They are strangers, watching. Freud may have called them doppelgangers: uncanny versions of our repressed selves. Jung may have seen them as unconscious personalities that we project on to others because of the struggles we have with ourselves. The shadows are not watching us, though: they’re watching the river.

Storm Claudia’s deluge bucketed through the Severn’s catchment; all the ditches, drains and brooks from the hills of mid-Wales to here burst with rain and runoff; piss and poison; anything not nailed down wound up in the river. The water roils darkly, its surface is pitted and wrinkled; there are swirls and vortices, pitches and gullies, an architecture formed by huge energies beneath.

No mallards surf the flow, the river has a deadly seriousness now. Birds keep a distance, hiding in stark vegetation behind the light and above the water. What happens to fish in this avalanche of suspended things, hammering through the border lowlands towards pinch points such as the Ironbridge Gorge? All those millions of tonnes of water shoot the bends, and, where there are no barriers, they spill. Fields and carparks become lakes; roads and hedges submerge, dividing nothing; floods have a weird stillness and a long memory.

The River Severn casts its shadow across the land. Whatever people have put in its way has little effect, and the strength and frequency of recent storms suggest the flood’s power will only increase. The Severn’s flood is a shadow life that does not belong entirely to the river that brings it or the land it covers; it’s uncanny, an animistic subconscious that arrives and departs with indifference.

The rewriting of Australia’s nature laws comes as a relief, yet I can’t help feel a sense of foreboding.

The Australian parliament is amending the country’s environment laws. Thanks to negotiating by the Greens, the amended laws will not enable the fast-tracking of coal and gas mining, which the government had proposed. Decisions about coal and gas mines that harm water resources will be retained by the commonwealth and not given over wholly to state governments as the government had proposed. That is an enormous relief.

And yet, I am filled with foreboding.
The bill introduced into parliament only a few weeks ago proposed to take the country backwards in environmental protection. It sought to strip communities of participation in environmental decisions, hand decision-making about environmental harm to the states and territories and give the environment minister sweeping power to tailor environmental regulations for certain developments, companies or industries.

The government made it clear from the outset that the convenience of business, the desire for “quick yesses” that could harm the natural environment, was its chief priority. It has been made clear that the government intends to grant fast-tracked approval to renewable energy developments and minerals mines. There is excited talk about “abundance” – which is code for sweeping forests, wetlands, woodlands and local communities out of the path of business, mining and development.

The minister is adamant this can be done while protecting the environment, but my 25 years of experience with environmental regulation tell me that haste brings unintended consequences. It makes communities angry. It leads to losses of our beautiful natural heritage that are mourned for generations. It impoverishes us by eroding the natural ecosystems that actually create the “abundance” that makes our society.
here is no abundance without reciprocity and we will learn this, to our sorrow, in the years to come if we continue treating the natural world as a magic pudding that can be cut and cut and cut and will come again.

Coal and gas mining will not be fast-tracked and for that I am very glad. But the government ruled out embedding any formal consideration of the impacts of greenhouse gas pollution, the effect of climate change on Australia’s natural heritage, into decision-making. Only a few months ago, Australia’s first national climate risk assessment itemised a devastating prognosis for Australia’s marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems across the continent if global warming exceeds the limits set down in the Paris climate agreement. It spoke of ecosystems collapsing and whole species dying out. The only way to prevent that warming is to stop the pollution that comes from burning coal, gas and oil for energy, and quickly. Indeed, an International Court of Justice advisory opinion has affirmed that all countries have a legal obligation to prevent climate harm and protect the climate system. For Australia, that means preventing the pollution from our energy exports.
The greenhouse gas emissions from Australia’s energy exports, and the impact that this pollution is having on Australians, is not going to go away because the minister refuses to think about it, or because the prime minister is too squeamish to talk about it. The consequences will plague our descendents for generations to come, long after this generation of politicians are gone, but there will be more immediate demands from communities suffering the effects of climate change that will become increasingly impossible to ignore.

Australia projected to miss 2035 emissions reduction target вЂby a country mileвЂ™ unless it ramps up climate policies

The Albanese government will need to substantially ramp up its climate policies to meet its recently announced 2035 emissions reduction target, according to an official projection that says it will otherwise be missed by a huge margin.
Government projections released on Thursday suggest under existing policies the country is on track to cut climate pollution by only 48% less than 2005 levels by 2035 вЂ“ well below its target of a cut of between 62% and 70% by that date.
The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, acknowledged the shortfall in an annual climate statement to parliament, saying вЂњadditional workвЂќ would be needed to meet the 2035 goal.
He said some policies that had been announced but not yet introduced were not counted in the projections, and that the government would meet the goal by вЂњimplementing, strengthening and building onвЂќ its policies.

вЂњIt is normal for there to be a gap between projected emissions and a target 10 years in the future. As new policies are developed and implemented, the emissions outlook improves,вЂќ Bowen said. вЂњThatвЂ™s what a target is for вЂ“ to drive new initiatives and work.вЂќ
The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said the projections were вЂњdiabolicalвЂќ and вЂњLaborвЂ™s addiction to coal, gas and forestryвЂќ meant it would miss the 2035 target announced in September вЂњby a country mileвЂќ.
вЂњItвЂ™s likely the true numbers are even worse, given the report seems to have excluded pricing in QueenslandвЂ™s decision to keep coal in the energy mix for a decade longer,вЂќ she said.

Waters said Labor should build on the deal it reached with the Greens to pass a revamp of environment laws to вЂњend native forest logging across the country and stop approving new coal and gas projectsвЂќ.
The projections suggested Labor was better placed to meet its 2030 emissions reducing target вЂ“ a 43% cut below 2005 levels. The projections suggest emissions will be 42% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.
But that assessment assumes the government will reach its goal of 82% of electricity coming from renewable energy, which independent experts say is not guaranteed, in part due to issues with transmission connections for new solar and windfarms and supply chain delays.
An annual progress report by the Climate Change Authority, a government agency, warned the pace of renewable energy growth over the past five years would need to more than double over the next five years to reach the 2030 goal.
Solar, wind and hydro power has provided about 42% of electricity in the countryвЂ™s main power grid over the past year. The government announced in July it would expand a renewables underwriting program to capitalise on declining costs for solar energy and batteries and help meet the 2030 target.
Data in a third report released on Thursday suggested national greenhouse gas emissions have begun to fall after largely flatlining since a sharp drop during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The quarterly emissions report said climate pollution was down 2.2% last financial year. Bowen said it was the largest annual drop due to reduced fossil fuel use outside the early year of the pandemic.\
About half of the 9.9m tonnes reduction was due to an increase in solar and wind generation pushing coal-fired power out of the system.
Pollution from power generation dropped 3.3%, or 5m tonnes. It reversed a brief rise in climate pollution from the power sector in the previous year.
There were smaller emissions reductions from underground coalmines, heavy industry, farming and households burning gas for heating and cooking.
But pollution from transport continued to increase due to greater use of diesel-power vehicles and more people taking domestic flights.
Annual emissions to June were 437.5m tonnes вЂ“ 28.5% below 2005 levels.
In a reply to BowenвЂ™s climate statement, the Coalition energy and emissions reduction spokesperson, Dan Tehan, focused on energy prices rather than the climate crisis. He accused the government of a вЂњbetrayalвЂќ over an undelivered pledge that power bills would fall by $275 between 2022 and 2025.
The Coalition recently confirmed it had abandoned its support for the national target of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050.
The reports released on Thursday do not include the emissions that result overseas from Australian coal and gas exports. A 2024 analysis found Australia ranked second behind Russia for exported emissions.




Ministers to crack down on вЂfor-profitвЂ™ litter enforcers in England

Ministers have signalled an imminent crackdown on so-called вЂњfor-profitвЂќ litter enforcement arrangements in England, where private firms are paid for each fixed penalty notice issued.
Under long-awaited statutory guidance, councils would have to end contracts that allow private enforcers to receive between 50% to 100% of each fine they serve.
Fixed penalty notices (FPN) for littering and breaching a public spaces protection order (PSPO) in the UK typically range from ВЈ100 to ВЈ200, or a potential prosecution in court with fines of up to ВЈ1,000 or more for serious offences.
PSPOs are used by local authorities to tackle specific anti-social behaviours in designated areas, such as dog fouling, street drinking, spitting and certain vehicle-related nuisances.
The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has indicated that it will implement statutory guidance banning fining for profit to вЂњhelp local authorities to consistently and appropriately exercise these powersвЂќ.
вЂњWe plan to bring forward statutory enforcement guidance on both littering and fly-tipping,вЂќ the policy paper said. вЂњWe will refresh and modernise the code of practice on litter and refuse in England to improve local authoritiesвЂ™ understanding of their duties.вЂќ
вЂњThis will be a big step,вЂќ said Josie Appleton, the director of the civil liberties group the Manifesto Club. вЂњThe fining-for-profit market accounts for the vast majority of both litter and PSPO penalties вЂ“ at least 75% of PSPO penalties came from private companies вЂ“ so the government will have to be firm if it wants to end the injustice.вЂќ
However, debate remains over what вЂњstatutory guidanceвЂќ will mean in practice. The current code of practice on litter and refuse, last updated in October 2023, already warns authorities to enforce proportionately and only when вЂњin the public interestвЂќ.
But those rules are still non-binding in many areas, and critics including Appleton said a formal ban was the only way to stop what she called вЂњinstitutionalised profit from public shameвЂќ.
Nayan Kisten said he was falsely accused of spitting by two private enforcement Kingdom Services officers in Tonbridge, Kent, last March.
Kisten said the officers approached him and demanded his ID without clearly explaining what the issue was or providing evidence.
Despite his denial and lack of objective evidence, Kisten was fined ВЈ125.
вЂњThe officers were really dismissive of any discussion. They just wanted to process the fine as quickly as possible,вЂќ he said. вЂњOnly once the fine was issued did they properly explain what was going on.
вЂњIt took me six months of repeated emails to the council and being endlessly stonewalled by them before it finally confirmed the fine had been cancelled,вЂќ he said.
вЂњBut I can see how people pay these fines out of fear, even when theyвЂ™re innocent. ItвЂ™s a scary, pressurising experience with the very real threat of a criminal record if you maintain your innocence,вЂќ he added.
Critics have long warned that outsourcing litter enforcement to private companies results in a high volume of fines for minor and borderline offences.
Although government guidance advising that revenue should not be a motivating factor, critics point to some performance-management contracts that explicitly tie reward to the number of penalties issued.
вЂњWhen private companies are paid per fine, it inevitably leads to absurd penalties and outrageous injustices,вЂќ said Appleton. вЂњBut at last it seems that Defra and the Home Office are paying attention and are ready to do something about it.вЂќ
Others have also urged the government to address the lack of formal appeal rights: currently, people who refuse to pay must defend themselves in court, with the risk of a criminal conviction, a ВЈ2,500 fine and costs if they lose.
Meanwhile, the penalties themselves are due to rise: from July, the upper limit for litter FPNs will increase from ВЈ150 to ВЈ500, as part of new legislation.
The Liberal Democrat peer Tim Clement-Jones has warned that raising fines so sharply, without properly curbing profit-linked enforcement, risks compounding existing inequities.
вЂњPrivate companies frequently issue grossly out-of-proportion penalties, the vast majority of which are issued for innocuous actions that fall far outside anyoneвЂ™s definition of serious anti-social behaviour,вЂќ he said.
He also criticised the lack of judicial scrutiny, arguing that the current FPN system вЂњundermines due process. They are issued solely based on the decision of an official and do not involve the production of evidence in courtвЂќ.
вЂњThis lack of judicial scrutiny means that when innocent people are fined for innocuous actions they often feel completely helpless, lacking the means to appeal a decision made by incentive-driven officers,вЂќ he added.
Defra has confirmed that it intends to publish the statutory guidance on littering enforcement in the new year.




Authentic Algarve: exploring Portugal beyond the beach

A series of walking festivals and cultural programmes aim to lure visitors to the AlgarveвЂ™s woodland interiors and pretty villages to help boost tourism year round
вЂInever mind doing the same walk over and over again,вЂќ said our guide, Joana Almeida, crouching beside a cluster of flowers. вЂњEach time, there are new things вЂ“ these werenвЂ™t here yesterday.вЂќ Standing on stems at least two centimetres tall and starring the dirt with white petals, the fact these star of Bethlehem flowers sprung up overnight was a beautiful testament to how quickly things can grow and regenerate in this hilly, inland section of the Algarve, the national forest of BarГЈo de SГЈo JoГЈo. It was also reassuring to learn that in an area swept by forest fires in September, species such as strawberry trees (which are fire-resistant thanks to their low resin content) were beginning to bounce back вЂ“ alongside highly flammable eucalyptus, which hinders other fire-retardant trees such as oak. Volunteers were being recruited to help with rewilding.
Visitor numbers to the Algarve are growing, with 2024 showing an increase of 2.6% on the previous year вЂ“ but most arrivals head straight for the beach, despite there being so much more to explore. The shoreline is certainly wild and dramatic but the region is also keen to highlight the appeal of its inland areas. With the development of year-round hiking and cycling trails, plus the introduction of nature festivals, attention is being drawn to these equally compelling landscapes, featuring mountains and dense woodlands. The Algarve Walking Season (AWS) runs a series of five walking festivals with loose themes such as вЂњwaterвЂќ and вЂњarchaeologyвЂќ between November and April. ItвЂ™s hoped they will inspire visitors year round, boosting the local economy and helping stem the tide of younger generations leaving in search of work.
Our visit to the national forest coincided with a weekend festival with the theme of вЂњartвЂќ, focused on the white-washed village north-west of BarГЈo de SГЈo JoГЈo. As well as guided hikes, departing from the cultural centre, free events ranged from learning how to make natural coloured inks, to theatre workshops, tai chi and sketching. There were two photography exhibitions running plus several other child-friendly activities, such as leaf safaris and making bird-feeders.
Even before our drop-in afternoon screen-printing session at the cultural centre our walk into the forest with Joana had the feeling of an art trail. Marked at the start by standing stones painted with images of traditional agricultural folk, it was studded en route with smaller, permanently placed stones depicting examples of wildlife, including hedgehogs and lynxes вЂ“ the latterвЂ™s population reviving, thanks to a rehabilitation centre based in the castle town of Silves.
As the trail wound up to its highest point, the menhir (standing stone) on the Pedra do Galo trail, it became more densely vegetated and a lingering hint of ash gave way to the resinous scent of pine. There was a ripeness to the air and solid, amber-hued bubbles bulged from bark. Limestone glistened underfoot and tiny frogs sat by pond edges, throats pulsing. In the distance, wind turbines cartwheeled against the sky.
Francisco SimГµes, our guide the following day, was again keen to point out these inland areas can be explored year-round. Waymarked hikes, established in recent years, are offshoots of the Via Algarviana, a route that stretches from the border with Spain for 186 miles, all the way to the Atlantic, and many are now linked to an app that makes navigation even easier.
rancisco established ecotourism outfit Algarvian Roots in 2020 and offers experiences from birdwatching to full-day guided hikes, all with the same aims as the AWS: to promote the region by way of immersion, education and cultural awareness. The art connection is here, too вЂ“ his mother, ceramicist Margarida Palma Gomes, had taught us to paint azulejos, the distinctive blue and white glazed tiles seen throughout the country, two days earlier on a festival workshop. Visits to her studio, as well as to a local potter, can also be arranged through Algarvian Roots.
Francisco urged us to do our bit for the industry by drinking generous quantities of good wine sealed with cork
After an excellent lunch of pork cheek and cabbage in A Charrette in Monchique, a pretty mountain town flanked by the AlgarveвЂ™s two highest peaks, the 902-metre FГіia and 774-metre Picota, Francisco led us down steeply cobbled streets and into a side lane, where an older couple sunned themselves at the front of their home. A steep path took us into the woods, the ground strewn with acorns. Here, Francisco was eager to show us cork trees, PortugalвЂ™s national tree and legally protected since the 13th century. Not only are they naturally fire-resistant, but their pliable bark is a source of income for locals, who harvest it to sell to other industries, particularly wine making and construction. Each tree is marked with a number, denoting when it was last stripped, ensuring that the treeвЂ™s nine-year regenerative cycle is observed.
Francisco has fears for the future of the cork trees вЂ“ not only are screw-tops now commonly used on wine bottles, but harvesting skills are dying out, as the next generation choose different career paths. Smiling, he urged us to do our bit for the industry by drinking generous quantities of good wine sealed with cork. We agreed, not very grudgingly, to do our best.
Earlier in the day, Francisco had shown us a wall covered in meticulously detailed azulejos depicting elements of traditional local life. One of these showed magusto, the annual festival where chestnuts are roasted on fires and shared by the community each November. This was perfect timing as, walking back into Monchique, strains of tinny, discordant music reached our ears, and a smell of smoke hung in the air. On arrival we were swept up by a multi-generational crowd, armed with cups of wine and thimblefuls of chestnut liqueur, as the nuts were roasted on glowing coals. Everyone swarmed around the firepits, brown paper bags in hand, and scooped their fill. Faces were wreathed with smiles and children shrieked excitedly; the music weвЂ™d winced at a few minutes earlier now had us dancing.
It was a joyful, authentic celebration of local life and culture. A reminder of the rewards awaiting those who leave the coast behind and head inland вЂ“ regardless of the season.
The trip was provided by Visit Algarve. For more information about the Algarve Walking Season festivals and schedule of free festival events visit algarvewalkingseason.com




LaborвЂ™s nature law overhaul contains wins вЂ“ but we should watch for gremlins in the details

We should start at the beginning in assessing the Labor-Greens deal to revamp AustraliaвЂ™s national environment law. And the beginning is that, ideally, you would not start from here.
Despite its name, the 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act was designed under John Howard to allow developments to go ahead, usually with conditions attached that may limit the damage to nature.
Forest at coupe AR012G, scheduled for logging in 2024, where citizen scientists have measured some of TasmaniaвЂ™s largest trees. Changes to AustraliaвЂ™s nature laws improve scrutiny of native forest logging, but there are concerns about other loopholes in the new environmental protections.
Seven ways AustraliaвЂ™s nature laws are changing after LaborвЂ™s deal with the Greens
Read more
The law does not prioritise environmental protection. It shouldnвЂ™t be a shock that it has spectacularly failed to deliver it. There is a case that the best approach would have been to scrap and replace the act.
Labor instead chose to amend the existing legislation, arguing it could improve it for both the environment and business, which has complained of long delays in approval decisions. It means the deal announced on Thursday is a repair job, not a complete rethink of how to best protect AustraliaвЂ™s unique wildlife and wild places as the country faces what scientists say is an extinction crisis.
It is worth noting there was no need for the changes to be rushed through this year. A committee inquiry is still under way. The Greens cut a deal at least in part because they feared if they didnвЂ™t, the governmentвЂ™s offer would evaporate and it would be content to make a much weaker agreement, from an environmental perspective, with the Coalition next year. The deadline was only political.

The result is the changes have not had proper scrutiny. The independent senator David Pocock had a point when he described the process as a farce. It means there are likely to be gremlins in the laws that will not be uncovered for a while.
But letвЂ™s look at what we do know.
From an environmental perspective: is this deal an improvement on the existing law? In some key ways, clearly yes.
The creation of a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce compliance and apply beefed-up penalties is a step forward вЂ“ if well used. The same applies to the creation of minimum national environment standards against which development applications will be assessed.
Plenty about the standards is still not known, though. Only two draft standards have been released, with more to come. As with so much of this, the details will matter.
The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature. The revamp would have been a joke without them.
Anthony Albanese
Labor strikes deal with Greens on nature laws overhaul amid criticism вЂdirty dealвЂ™ being вЂrammed throughвЂ™
Read more
This change wonвЂ™t stop logging or land-clearing, but will boost legal and social pressure on the logging industries in Tasmania and New South Wales. Anthony Albanese basically acknowledged this on Thursday, saying the forest industry was increasingly reliant on plantation timber вЂ“ it already provides nearly 90% of wood in Australia вЂ“ and that the government would kick in $300m for a вЂњforestry growth fundвЂќ as it moved in that direction.
The GreensвЂ™ demand that fossil fuel projects cannot be fast-tracked in the way other developments can вЂ“ renewable energy and housing, for example вЂ“ makes obvious sense as far as it goes.
It also makes sense that Labor has dropped a proposal to give states and territories the power to make decisions on large coalmining and unconventional gas projects that affect groundwater or waterways under plans to вЂњstreamline decision-makingвЂќ. Water resources are a national issue, and should have federal oversight.
Here the politics get a little murky. Did Labor actually ever really plan to give up power over what is known as the вЂњwater triggerвЂќ? At least some of the вЂњconcessionsвЂќ to the Greens вЂ“ the commitment to axe the logging loophole, for example вЂ“ were steps the government had said it was prepared to make, but held back for the final negotiations.
Similarly, itвЂ™s an open question whether the environment minister, Murray Watt, and those around him really believed an agreement could be landed with the divided and self-destructing Coalition, despite repeated claims that he was prepared to make concessions either way. If a deal was done it was always likely to be with the Greens. They donвЂ™t call Watt a political fixer for nothing.
Back on the positives: one of the more contentious issues in the debate over the laws has been whether to include a definition of вЂњunacceptable impactsвЂќ that should in theory lead to quick вЂњnoвЂќ decisions on some developments. It stayed in. Again, the details and interpretation will be crucial.
But there are also problems, and many unanswered questions.
The amended laws lean heavily on the use of offsets, which basically allow some nature to be bulldozed as long as other areas are protected. As Guardian AustraliaвЂ™s Lisa Cox has shown, offset schemes have repeatedly not delivered anything like what has been promised.
The rewriting of AustraliaвЂ™s nature laws comes as a relief, yet I canвЂ™t help feel a sense of foreboding
Georgina Woods

The government has proposed a вЂњrestoration contribution fundвЂќ that will allow developers to kick in cash in return for permission to do some environmental damage. This sort of model, which critics have called a вЂњpay-to-destroyвЂќ fund, failed spectacularly in NSW. The negotiations with the Greens have introduced some limits, but many people will be sceptical whether the вЂњnet gainвЂќ for nature that Watt has promised can be guaranteed.
Non-fossil fuel developments will be able to be fast-tracked, with decisions promised in as little as 30 days and in some cases left to the states. The country needs a rapid rollout of renewable energy, but this timeframe risks squashing the rights of communities to test and object to developments.
The laws also maintain the existing approach of giving the environment minister significant discretion over how the act is used. Experts say this includes in some cases the authority to approve developments they consider in the national interest, and a вЂњrulings powerвЂќ that could limit legal challenges.
Finally, the laws go close to ignoring what will ultimately be the greatest threat to much of the environment вЂ“ the climate crisis. Developers will have to disclose their expected emissions, but this information will have no bearing on whether a project goes ahead. As has been said many times before, this defies logic.
It means that вЂ“ even as conservationists celebrate victories that have been the result of years of dedicated campaigning вЂ“ the arguments over what more is needed to give Australian nature the protection it deserves will continue.

Cuddling capybaras and ogling otters: the problem with animal cafes in Asia

A boom in places offering petting sessions is linked to a rise in the illegal movement of exotic and endangered species, say experts
The second floor of an unassuming office building in central Bangkok is a strange place to encounter the worldвЂ™s largest rodent. Yet here, inside a small enclosure with a shallow pool, three capybaras are at the disposal of dozens of paying customers вЂ“ all clamouring for a selfie. As people eagerly thrust leafy snacks toward the nonchalant-looking animals, few seem to consider the underlying peculiarity: how, exactly, did this South American rodent end up more than 10,000 miles from home, in a bustling Asian metropolis?
Capybara cafes have been cropping up across the continent in recent years, driven by the animalвЂ™s growing internet fame. The semi-aquatic animals feature in more than 600,000 TikTok posts. In Bangkok, cafe customers pay 400 baht (ВЈ9.40) for a 30-minute petting session with them, along with a few meerkats and Chinese bamboo rats. Doors are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

вЂњThe amount of diversity and the number of animals вЂ“ and, in particular, quite a few threatened animals вЂ“ is very concerning,вЂќ says Timothy Bonebrake, a conservation biologist at the University of Hong Kong who has studied the growth of exotic animal cafes in Asia.
Even a cursory online search yields capybara cafes in places such as Jakarta, Qingdao, and Hanoi. The rodents are not classified as endangered вЂ“ they range from northern Colombia down to northern Argentina, with an estimated 1.2 million roaming BrazilвЂ™s wetlands and cities. But, вЂњthe reason they are not endangered is because they are abundant in Brazil where they are protectedвЂќ, says Congdon, who says that in Venezuela and Colombia they live mostly in protected areas.
The international trade in capybaras is not regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), though exporting native wild capybaras remains illegal in many South American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Peru. Experts say the rodentsвЂ™ movement from South America to Asia is often linked to the illegal pet trade, with the same people moving species across international borders.
вЂњLegal and illegal supply chains for live animals converge at multiple points, and are often controlled by the same people and companies,вЂќ says Scott Roberton, executive director of a team countering wildlife trafficking at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).
The capybaras at the Bangkok cafe are вЂњfrom ethic [sic] farms in Thailand. We donвЂ™t import them from their original country,вЂќ according to a small sign in the animalsвЂ™ enclosure. However, Roberton says: вЂњLaundering of illegally caught animals into legal supply chains is very common, with those animals often then used to establish or supplement breeding stock.вЂќ
Species at risk of extinction have also been swept up in the pet trade for exotic animal cafes. This year, a study linked small-clawed otters found in Japanese animal cafes to two poaching hotspots in southern Thailand вЂ“ violating a ban on the commercial trade of the vulnerable species.
Concerns about the growth in the illegal pet trade вЂ“ including for animal cafes вЂ“ prompted members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to adopt a motion targeted at curbing the illegal pet trade at its October congress meeting.
вЂњThe global pet trade is really out of control, from a conservation perspective,вЂќ says Sue Lieberman, vice-president of international policy at WCS. вЂњIn the past five years, we have seen much more pet trade in Asia. We used to talk about the food trade in China, but now the pet trade in China is increasing with all these pet cafes.вЂќ
A survey of one of ChinaвЂ™s largest databases on corporations, Qichacha, reveals that the number of businesses listed as petting zoos, which includes animal cafes, shot up from fewer than 100 in 2020 to more than 1,800 in 2025. And while private pet ownership in China increased by 50% over the past five years, pet cafes have been growing at 200% annually.
A comprehensive analysis of recent growth in the number of exotic animal cafes across the whole of Asia is lacking, but one study co-authored by Bonebrake in the journal Conservation Letters found there were 406 animal cafes across Asia in 2019, just over a quarter of which contained exotic species. And of the more than 250 exotic species recorded, nearly half were threatened with extinction or had a decreasing population in the wild.
Even in the absence of conservation concerns about imported species, some countries are worried about the movement of exotic animals for cafes. In May, police seized five capybaras from traffickers in Costa Rica, where trading capybaras is illegal due to fears they could escape and flourish in the wild. Capybaras breed rapidly, can withstand a wide range of temperatures, and have a flexible diet of grasses and aquatic plants. вЂњThere is a high risk for them to be invasive,вЂќ Congdon says.
The impact of pet cafes on the illegal wildlife trade isnвЂ™t just limited to the animals moving through a venueвЂ™s doors, says Roberton, but how they may stimulate demand. вЂњSuddenly, youвЂ™re encouraging people that there is this cool, big exotic animal that you can pet and feed. How many people leave that cafe and go, вЂI want a baby capybaraвЂ™?вЂќ




Weatherwatch: Can you really hear the wind?

Some would argue airflow is silent, and that only the objects in its way give rise to vortex shedding or sough
The evocative sound of wind in the trees, called psithurism or sough, occurs when the smooth, вЂњlaminarвЂќ flow of air becomes turbulent around branches, twigs and leaves. The different scales of obstruction give rise to a mix of different frequencies of sound, resulting in something like white noise. Wind through pine trees is higher pitched because of the smaller size of pine needles, making a hissing or whispering sound.
When indoors you may sometimes hear the wind howling. That sound is the airflow interacting with the sharp edges, gaps and openings of buildings, producing a note in the same way as blowing over the top of an empty bottle does. These are known as Aeolian tones after Aeolus, the Greek god of winds.
When this effect, technically known as vortex shedding, matches the resonant frequency of an object such as a taut wire or line, the wire vibrates and hums in turn. It becomes an Aeolian harp string.
Even where there are no other objects, what appears to be the sound of the wind is actually distorted airflow around the external structure of your ears.
A pedant might argue that the wind itself is silent. What we hear is the just sound of various objects blowinвЂ™ in the wind.




Rachel Reeves hands farmers inheritance tax break

Treasury says concession could be worth ВЈ30m next year and then ВЈ70m annually until 2030
Rachel Reeves has eased inheritance tax on agricultural property after pressure from farmers.
As the chancellor made her budget speech on Wednesday, the Treasury announced changes it said could save farmers and business owners ВЈ30m next year when passing on property and ВЈ70m a year in the following four years. Farmers, who had driven tractors up to the doors of parliament, were protesting outside at the same time.
From April, farmers and small business owners who are married, are in a civil partnership or have deceased spouses, will be able transfer their inheritance tax allowance of up to ВЈ1m of full relief to each other if one of them dies without having used their allowance. The change means a farmer could leave their ВЈ1m allowance to their partner, and use their own ВЈ1m allowance, to pass on ВЈ2m of farmland to their children without paying inheritance tax.
The chancellorвЂ™s announcement in last OctoberвЂ™s budget that she was bringing farms and other agricultural property into inheritance tax rules to raise money for public services and close a tax loophole exploited by some wealthy landowners prompted large-scale protests.
Farmers drowned out ministersвЂ™ speeches with tractor horns after Reeves said she was ending a decades-long exemption for farms and would make inheritors pay 20% of the value of agricultural and business property above ВЈ1m.
On Wednesday morning, before the budget, farmers defied police restrictions and parked more than a dozen tractors around Trafalgar Square and protested in Whitehall over a number of issues, including inheritance tax. Several people were arrested.
David Gunn, an arable farmer and agricultural contractor from near Sevenoaks in Kent, said his message to Labour was: вЂњYou said in the manifesto you would look after the farmers, which you totally havenвЂ™t, youвЂ™ve ruined the countryside.вЂќ
The tax expert Dan Neidle said the chancellor had made a вЂњsensible changeвЂќ that meant farmers would not need to take extensive long-term tax planning measures.
Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National FarmersвЂ™ Union, said: вЂњItвЂ™s good to see the government accepts its original proposals were flawed. But this change goes nowhere near far enough to remove the devastating impact of the policy on farming communities.вЂќ
He added that the change would help widowed farmers but вЂњit does nothing to alleviate the burden it puts on the elderly and vulnerableвЂќ and urged the government to address this with further measures.




Country diary: The river has risen to meet the trees. This is Storm ClaudiaвЂ™s work

Welsh Marches, Shropshire: All the ditches and drains from the hills of mid-Wales to here burst with rain. The Severn has a deadly seriousness now
Low sunlight casts the shadows of figures, standing on the Frankwell footbridge in Shrewsbury across the River Severn, into trees. The willows have shaken loose from leafing, and the light that strikes them has a brilliance no longer absorbed by hungry foliage. The trees are illuminated, freed from the processes of growth, and the river has risen to meet them.
The shadows stand in the golden branches above a bend in the river, and look back at us. They are dark and shift slightly, mirroring our movements, but not enough to feel we are the same thing. WeвЂ™re not. They are strangers, watching. Freud may have called them doppelgangers: uncanny versions of our repressed selves. Jung may have seen them as unconscious personalities that we project on to others because of the struggles we have with ourselves. The shadows are not watching us, though: theyвЂ™re watching the river.
Storm ClaudiaвЂ™s deluge bucketed through the SevernвЂ™s catchment; all the ditches, drains and brooks from the hills of mid-Wales to here burst with rain and runoff; piss and poison; anything not nailed down wound up in the river. The water roils darkly, its surface is pitted and wrinkled; there are swirls and vortices, pitches and gullies, an architecture formed by huge energies beneath.
No mallards surf the flow, the river has a deadly seriousness now. Birds keep a distance, hiding in stark vegetation behind the light and above the water. What happens to fish in this avalanche of suspended things, hammering through the border lowlands towards pinch points such as the Ironbridge Gorge? All those millions of tonnes of water shoot the bends, and, where there are no barriers, they spill. Fields and carparks become lakes; roads and hedges submerge, dividing nothing; floods have a weird stillness and a long memory.
The River Severn casts its shadow across the land. Whatever people have put in its way has little effect, and the strength and frequency of recent storms suggest the floodвЂ™s power will only increase. The SevernвЂ™s flood is a shadow life that does not belong entirely to the river that brings it or the land it covers; itвЂ™s uncanny, an animistic subconscious that arrives and departs with indifference.

Seven ways AustraliaвЂ™s nature laws are changing after LaborвЂ™s deal with the Greens

Legislation to reform the EPBC Act runs to hundreds of pages вЂ“ here are the main changes
Long-awaited changes to AustraliaвЂ™s national environmental laws will pass the Senate on Thursday after a deal between the Albanese government and the Greens.
The hundreds of pages of legislation to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act include commitments to improve scrutiny of native forest logging and new fast track assessment measures for some developments.
Here are seven key features of the new laws:
1. Establishing a federal environment protection agency
The legislation will deliver on LaborвЂ™s main environmental commitment to establish a national EPA.
The government says it will be operational by 1 July 2026. The new agency will be responsible for enforcing the law and imposing penalties for environmental breaches, which will be higher than they previously were for the most serious offences. The EPA will also have the power to issue stop-work orders of up to 14 days where breaches are suspected.
The environment minister will have the option to delegate their power to decide if a project should go ahead to the new EPA, or to make the decision themselves. A similar set-up is already in place, where the minister can personally make the decision or delegate it to the environment department. It stops short of making the new EPA an independent decision-making authority.
2. Creating national environmental standards
The legislation gives the environment minister the power to create national environmental standards, the key recommendation of a 2020 review of the EPBC Act.
A lot of the power of these new laws to genuinely deliver for the environment hinges on the strength of these standards. So far, the government has released two draft standards for consultation: one on matters of national environmental significance such as threatened species and another on biodiversity offsets. Others, including a standard on First Nations engagement, are вЂњunder developmentвЂќ. A Senate inquiry examining the legislation will continue into next year so the proposed standards can be scrutinised.
3. Introduction of вЂnet gainвЂ™ and вЂunacceptable impactsвЂ™ tests
The new laws require developers to show the damage their projects cause to the environment is compensated for with actions resulting in overall environmental benefit: a вЂњnet gainвЂќ. Projects that have вЂњunacceptable impactsвЂќ will be refused.
But the devil will be in the detail here. In his Thursday press conference, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, indicated concessions had been made to industry, noting that business called for a clearer definition of unacceptable impacts. Scientists and legal experts had also said the original definitions proposed were too vague.
The amended bills have tightened language to require that an unacceptable impact be certain to occur, rather than вЂњlikelyвЂќ.
4. Ministerial discretion
Environment advocates and legal experts had expressed serious concern that the original legislation introduced to parliament gave the environment minister too much power to decide if developments went ahead, and what conditions were applied to protect threatened plants, animals and ecosystems.
Because of a key concession secured by the Greens, a widely criticised exemption that would allow the minister to approve a development in breach of nature laws if it was considered in the вЂњnational interestвЂќ cannot be applied to coal and gas projects.
But other concerns remain вЂ“ in particular, that language saying the minister must only be вЂњsatisfiedвЂќ a development complies with the law and meets certain environmental benchmarks has been retained throughout the legislation.
There is also a provision for the minister to make вЂњrulingsвЂќ about how standards or other elements of the act should be applied to particular proponents, actions or industries. Independent senator David Pocock and scientific experts including the Biodiversity Council have expressed serious concerns that this is an overreach.
5. Fast-tracked developments, state decisions
The new laws abolish some of the actвЂ™s old assessment methods and replace them with a streamlined 30-day project approval pathway. As above, the Greens secured agreement this pathway will not be applied to coal and gas projects. But it can be used for other projects that harm nature.
The government will also be able to transfer decision-making powers вЂ“ about whether or not a development can proceed вЂ“ to state and territory governments. This has been a major ask from industry. Under the deal with the Greens, there will be some limits on when and how these bilateral approval agreements can occur.
The government has agreed to retain responsibility for decisions under the federal water trigger and not delegate that power to states and territories.
6. Logging exemptions closed, land-clearing loophole restricted
Perhaps the biggest win from the deal is that the effective exemption from national laws granted to native forest logging operations covered by regional forest agreements will be removed in 18 months. Native forest logging operations will be subject to national standards, unacceptable impacts and net gain tests and will be monitored by the EPA.
The laws will also tighten an agricultural land-clearing loophole. Clearing of vegetation older than 15 years will no longer be exempt from assessment and approval under the EPBC Act. Additionally, any land-clearing within 50m of waterways in Great Barrier Reef catchments must be assessed.
7. Changes to the offset framework
Environmental offsets allow developers to compensate for damage they cause by restoring habitat for the same species or ecosystem elsewhere.
The governmentвЂ™s proposal to introduce a вЂњrestoration contributions fundвЂќ that developers could pay into, rather than finding and securing an offset themselves, has been retained. Guardian Australia understands there will be some restrictions on what species and вЂњprotected mattersвЂќ can be offset through the fund, but details remain to be seen.
The new fund would also relax вЂњlike-for-likeвЂќ rules that previously required offsets to deliver an environmental benefit for the same species or ecosystem affected by a development.





A win for nature and peopleвЂ™: Elizabeth line soil used to create Essex bird haven

A record 39,000 birds are overwintering on Wallasea island wetlands thanks to soil transported from London tunnels
Almost 40,000 birds have made their home on a nature reserve created using soil from tunnel excavations for the Elizabeth line.
Three million tonnes of earth were transported from London to Wallasea island in Essex and used to lift the ground level and make wetlands.
The RSPB bought the island in the mid-2000s and has been constructing the ideal conditions for wetland birds to feed, nest and refuel. The sea wall was removed in 2015 to make water flow on to the island for the first time in 400 years.
The charity then constructed islands, some of them from the Elizabeth line soil, and created lagoons and salt marshes. The wetland area now protects residents against flooding by absorbing storm waters.
Wallasea was once bereft of birds but now its visitors include 800 avocets, more than 10,000 knot waders, nearly 3,000 grey plovers and a similar number of bar-tailed godwits. It has reached a record of 39,000 birds overwintering on the site.
Rachael Fancy, the site manager, said: вЂњWhen I first started working at Wallasea it looked an awful lot like a construction site вЂ“ because thatвЂ™s what it was. But just 10 years on, thereвЂ™s no evidence of the diggers or trucks. ThereвЂ™s just thousands and thousands of birds who now use it as a refuge, shelter and nursery for their chicks. ItвЂ™s an almost unbelievable transformation.вЂќ
Project managers said successful use of soil from the Elizabeth line showed that construction and nature restoration could go hand in hand.
Milo Sumner, coastal programmes manager at RSPB England, said: вЂњWallasea shows whatвЂ™s possible when business has an ethos of working with, and alongside, nature. The creation of the Elizabeth line was one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in decades, and by collaborating we were able to create a win for nature and people from what would otherwise have been a huge pile of wasted soil.
вЂњWeвЂ™d like to say a huge thank you to Transport for London for jumping on this opportunity, and of course to our teams and volunteers who helped make it a reality.вЂќ

1.	Zillow deletes climate risk data from listings after complaints it harms sales
Site removes feature after real estate agents and some homeowners say scores appear arbitrary and hurt sales
Zillow, the US’s largest real estate listing site, has removed a feature that allowed people to view a property’s exposure to the climate crisis, following complaints from the industry and some homeowners that it was hurting sales.
In September last year, the online real estate marketplace introduced a tool showing the individual risk of wildfire, flood, extreme heat, wind and poor air quality for 1m properties it lists, explaining that “climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions” for many Americans.
But Zillow has now deleted this climate index after complaints from real estate agents and some homeowners that the rankings appeared arbitrary, could not be challenged and harmed house sales. The complaints included those from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which oversees a database of property data that Zillow relies upon.
Zillow said it remains committed to help Americans make informed decisions about properties, with listings now containing outbound links to the website of First Street, the non-profit climate risk quantifier that had provided the on-site tool to Zillow.
Matthew Eby, founder and chief executive of First Street, said that removing the climate risk information means that many buyers will be “flying blind” in an era when worsening impacts of extreme weather are warping the real estate market in the US.
“The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability,” Eby said. “Families discover after a flood that they should have purchased flood insurance, or discover after the sale that wildfire insurance is unaffordable or unavailable in their area.
“Access to accurate risk information before a purchase isn’t just helpful; it’s essential to protecting consumers and preventing lifelong financial consequences.”
Eby claimed that the push to delist the First Street ratings from Zillow is linked to a challenging real estate environment, with a lack of affordable housing and repeated climate-driven disasters that are causing insurers to raise premiums or even flee states such as California.
“All of that adds pressure to close sales however possible,” he said. “Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient. It became harder to ignore in a stressed market.”
As the US, along with the rest of the world, has heated up due to the burning of fossil fuels, worsening extreme weather events have taken their toll directly upon people’s homes, as well as other infrastructure.
Last year, disasters probably amplified by the climate crisis caused $182bn in damages, one of the highest on record, according to a government database since taken offline by the Trump administration.
As a consequence of these mounting risks, the home insurance required for buyers to obtain a mortgage is becoming scarcer and more expensive across much of the US. These changes are running headlong into an opposing trend whereby more Americans are moving to places such as Florida and the south-west, which are being increasingly beset by threats such as ruinous hurricanes and punishing heatwaves.
But assigning climate risks to individual properties has been controversial within the real estate industry, as well as some experts who have questioned whether such judgments can be made at such a granular level.

Warnings of such perils deterred some buyers, especially if the home was particularly costly anyway. Last year, a sprawling Florida mansion was put on sale for $295m, making it the most expensive property in the country and in a place also ranked as one of the most at-risk in the US for flooding. After several cuts to the asking price, the house has been taken off the market.
Jesse Keenan, an author and expert in climate risk management at Tulane University, said many scientists and economists have argued that “proprietary risk models that provide highly uncertain assessments can have the perverse effect of undermining the public’s confidence in climate science.
“There has been a growing bipartisan recognition that the government should play a more active role in supporting and standardizing risk assessment for properties,” Keenan said. “At the same time, the science is limited in its capacity to assess property-by-property assessments.
“I do not believe that this is a sign that the brokerage industry is trying to hide climate risks,” he added. “Brokerage firms know they cannot stop the transmission of climate risk information because climate impacts are already being felt far and wide in the sector.”
Eby defended First Street’s methods and accuracy, pointing out that the models used were built on peer-reviewed science and validated against real-world outcomes.
“So when claims are made that our models are inaccurate, we ask for evidence,” he said. “To date, all the empirical validation shows our science is working as designed and providing better risk insight than the tools the industry has relied on historically.”


2.	Garden ponds provide vital habitats – and a revival is under way in Britain
Even tiny ponds can create biodiversity hotspots, as well as helping out during heatwaves and heavy rain
A few years ago I created a little pond in my back garden. It’s barely bigger than a paving slab, but since the pond has been in place we have had a garden teeming with frogs, hedgehogs have taken up residence and bird life has abounded.
Not only do humble ponds like this give nature a boost; they also help to buffer climate extremes. In recent decades, Britain’s ponds have been disappearing, with research revealing that more than half of our dense network of ponds has been lost since the 1900s. Lucy Clarke and colleagues found that 58% of ponds in the Severn Vale region of the UK had been lost since the 1900s, with the average distance between ponds increasing by 25 metres over that time. Similar trends can be seen worldwide, with intensive agriculture and urbanisation obliterating these seemingly insignificant bodies of water.
But now a pond revival is under way, with even tiny ponds such as mine helping to create biodiversity hotspots, plus provide cooling during heatwaves and help to slow the flow of water during heavy rains, reducing pressure on our overloaded drains and recharging parched groundwater reservoirs. Previously overlooked, ponds large and small are starting to be recognised as a vital habitat and a small but mighty climate mitigation tool.

3.	The environmental costs of corn: should the US change how it grows its dominant crop?
Amid concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration has abolished climate-friendly farming incentives
This article was produced in partnership with Floodlight
For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90m acres – about the size of Montana – and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.
But a growing body of research reveals that the US’s obsession with corn has a steep price: the fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.
Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.
Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when the nitrogen in the fertilizer breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol – which now consumes 40% of the US corn crop – is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.
Industry is also pushing for ethanol-based jet fuel and higher-ethanol gasoline blends as growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.
Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of US greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide – making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.
Since 2000, US corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.
The environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy – and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), passed in the mid-2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.
Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn”, demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.
At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50bn in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
Researchers say proven conservation steps – such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in cornfields – could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.
Experts say it all raises a larger question: if the US’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it in a different way?
How corn took over the US
In the late 1990s, the US’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom”.
Corn production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of the US’s corn crop into ethanol.
In 2001, the US Department of Agriculture launched the bioenergy program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 farm bill created programs supporting ethanol and other renewable energy.
Corn growers soon mounted an all-out campaign to persuade Congress to require that gasoline be blended with ethanol, arguing it cut greenhouse gasses, reduced oil dependence and revived rural economies.
“I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying: ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you,’” Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, said in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”
In 2005, Congress created the RFS, which requires adding ethanol to gasoline, and expanded it two years later. The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.
When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, was more land cleared to grow corn. The Global Carbon Project found that nitrous oxide emissions from human activity rose 40% from 1980 to 2020.
In the United States, “king corn” became a political force. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55m on lobbying and millions more on political donations to Democrats and Republicans alike, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.
In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Now the sectors are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.
Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims
Corn and ethanol trade groups did not respond to requests for interviews. But they have long promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.
The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40%-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong – and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.
“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.
Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that US farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial”, using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint. “Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.
Some research tells a different story.
A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the midwest – with the same fields planted in corn year after year – carries a heavy climate cost.
And research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to worsening water pollution and increased emissions, concluding the climate impact is “no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher”.
Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling – a charge Lark’s team has rejected.
One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.
“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”
Nitrogen polluting rural drinking water
The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution, experts say.
According to a new report by Clean Wisconsin and the Alliance for the Great Lakes, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources – mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.
In 2022, Tyler Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles (32km) east of Green Bay. Testing found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” Frye said.
He installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.
When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”
What cleaner corn could look like
Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible – but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.
Recent moves by the Trump administration have stripped out Biden-era incentives for climate-friendly farming practices, which the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, dismissed as part of the “green new scam”.
Research, however, shows that proven conservation practices – including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields – could make a measurable difference.
In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson is planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer on 130 of the 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of corn and soybeans she farms with her father. Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They have also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” – bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.
They were counting on $20,000 a year from the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, but it never came.
“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps.”
In south-east Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres. He uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller crimping: flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.
“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” Lyle said.
Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel.
Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based aviation fuel could prompt another 114m acres to be converted to corn, or 20% more corn acres than the US plants for all purposes.
“The result,” said University of Iowa professor and natural resources economist Silvia Secchi, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”
4.	Trump says he will repeal Biden-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks
Move marks president’s latest effort to dismantle pollution regulations and support for cleaner-running vehicles
Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he is repealing the Biden-era federal fuel economy standards, significantly weakening fuel efficiency requirements for tens of millions of new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks.
It marks the US president’s latest effort to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for cleaner-running vehicles and renewable energy. Burning gasoline is a significant contributor to global heating and transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
“We are officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, Cafe standards that imposed expensive restrictions,” Trump said in an Oval Office announcement, flanked by top auto executives including the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis. “It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate.”
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (Cafe) standards, first established in 1975, set the average fuel economy targets for new vehicles and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more fuel-efficient.
The Biden administration proposed modest increases to the requirements for the vehicles most Americans drive as part of a push to promote electric vehicles and address the climate emergency. Joe Biden required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031.
Trump is now rolling that back, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The standards proposed by him would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Wednesday’s announcement marks the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner energy vehicles, including relaxing auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal mileage standards and terminating consumer credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.
Trump, who calls the climate crisis a “hoax” and whose administration is in the grips of a cost of living crisis, said he was seeking to weaken the rules in order to make new cars more affordable. “These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [former transportation secretary Pete] Buttigieg want them to build,” said his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, who was also in the Oval Office. “This is important for American jobs. The more cars we sell, the more jobs we have in this country.”’
Gutting the Cafe program would “make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash”, Katherine García, the director of the Clean Transportation for All program at the Sierra Club, said in a statement.
Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said that current efficiency standards have motivated automakers to produce cars that use less gas, saving consumers money at the pump. “Trump’s action will feed America’s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against … foreign carmakers,” he added. “The auto industry will use this rule to drive itself back into a familiar ditch, failing to compete.”

5.	‘The dinosaurs didn’t know what was coming, but we do’: Marina Silva on what needs to follow Cop30
Jonathan Watts
Exclusive: Brazil’s environment minister talks about climate inaction and the course we have to plot to save ourselves and the planet
Soon after I returned home to Altamira from Cop30, I found myself talking about dinosaurs, meteors and “ambassadors of harm” with Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva.
No one in government knows the rainforest better than Marina, as she is best known in Brazil, who was born and raised in the Amazon. No one is more aware of the sacrifices that environmental and land defenders have made than this associate of the murdered activist Chico Mendes. And no one worked harder to raise ambition at Cop30, the first climate summit in the Amazon, than her. So what, I asked, had it achieved?
“This Cop revealed the truth that efforts until now have been insufficient,” she told me in a video call from Brasilia. “Our climate efforts continue, as ever, to buy time when we have no more time.”
In a tearful and defiant address to the closing plenary of the conference in Belém, Marina had told applauding delegates that she – like many others – had dreamed of achieving more when they attended the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, which set up UN conventions for the climate, biodiversity and desertification. What had she meant by that?
“Reality itself says we did less than was necessary,” she replied. “But what gives us hope is we managed to maintain the connection between dream and action during these 30 or so years. If we didn’t have the Paris agreement and the efforts that preceded it, the planet would be on course for 4C of warming [above preindustrial levels].
“Thanks to these efforts, global heating hasn’t reached that level and if that were to be counted in lives, in food systems, in energy systems, in technological advances, we would see that we have had many gains, that we have avoided many catastrophes, that we have saved many lives, many portions of food, and we have managed to preserve more areas of land from being totally devastated by desertification or by the rise in sea levels.
“But our efforts are still insufficient. And now there is no more room for insufficiency, only a tiny crack for action remains. And when possibilities narrow, efforts to broaden them must be carried out with all speed, intensity and quality.”
No one in the Amazon could doubt the need for urgency. The rainforest has dried up like never before in the past three years. On the way home, I was horrified to see a new stretch of forest had been burned along the side of the road during the three weeks I had been away.
Marina said she had hoped that visitors to the Belém conference would see that a climate collapse was already under way in the rainforest. “Having a tropical forest that is losing humidity is science materialised in three dimensions: mighty rivers that dry up for long periods, to the point of killing the fish, harming biodiversity and isolating populations that have always remained integrated with each other through natural water channels,” she said. “I think Cop30 in the Amazon was a place to demonstrate and denounce what is happening and a place to initiate a response.”
The response came in the form of a bold move, supported by more than 80 countries and civil society, which dominated debate in Belém – a push to set a course for a just and planned transition away from fossil fuels and deforestation. It was backed by climatologists, championed by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and largely orchestrated by Marina.
The plan was cut from the final mutirão or joint decision – along with all mention of fossil fuels – after opposition from Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing states.
But the idea of creating roadmaps to reduce dependency on oil, coal and gas will be taken forward by the Brazilian Cop presidency over the coming year. Marina insisted this was a great start. “The scientific community is celebrating that finally something has been put on the table to debate what really matters,” she said. “We recognise the outcome was not yet enough, but we must also recognise that what was put on the table is the response that we should have been working on for the past 30-odd years.”
Each country should choose its own speed, she said. Oil and coal producers might need to move more slowly, but everyone needs to move in the same direction: “Being fair does not detract from the need to act. Being fair is just the basis on which we will take action.”
The power of extractivist economic interests to delay and reverse climate action has also been apparent in Brazil. Congress, which is dominated by agribusiness interests, overturned several of Lula’s vetoes of a controversial bill to dilute environmental licensing just days after Cop30.
Given these forces, how could governments ever push forward progressive policies on the climate and nature? For Marina, it is necessary to go to a deeper level of values. Ultimately, she said, it is a matter of survival – not just of an individual or a species, but the very conditions in which life is possible.
Compared with the huge efforts to preserve the economic system after the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, and the immense military spending under way in Europe, itwas incredible how little was going into the campaign to stabilise the climate and nature, she said. “Something is wrong. And it’s not just wrong with the dynamics of multilateralism. It’s wrong with the ethical values ​​that are guiding our decisions.
“Recently we moved to confront the problem of Covid-19. Why are we only able to do this when the harm has already been done? Why don’t we show that ability when the problem has been detected and proven and already sending us its most malevolent ambassadors in the form of fires, heatwaves, ever-more-intense typhoons and hurricanes, loss of areas that were previously used to produce food and reduction in hydroelectric power generation capacity?
“The visits of these sinister ambassadors should be enough for us to make preparations in a way the dinosaurs were unable to do. They didn’t know a large meteor was coming towards them. We know what is coming towards us, we know what needs to be done and we have the means to do it, yet we don’t take the necessary measures.”
Marina is planning to do all she can to change that. The Brazilian government will push forward with a debate on roadmaps to halt deforestation and fossil fuels. It will participate in the first international conference on a just transition away from oil, coal and gas in Colombia next year.
And it will try to lead by example, she says. “I am inspired by the fact we have reduced deforestation by 50% in the Amazon and agribusiness has grown by 17% in the last three years. This demonstrates it is possible to do this,” she said. “If we are not determined to achieve, we will apparently remain in the same place. And I say apparently because we are already heading towards an unthinkable place, where the very conditions of life are diminished.”

6.	Scientists uncover surprise origin of wispy cirrus clouds
These delicate cloud systems appear to be seeded by massive atmospheric waves thousands of miles away
Cirrus clouds are our highest clouds; their delicate wispy strands are like an artist’s brushstrokes through the sky. During the day they are bright white and at dawn and dusk they can take on the hues of sunrise and sunset. But how are they made? New research reveals that some cirrus clouds are seeded by storms on the other side of the world, many thousands of miles away. This has implications for global heating as storm patterns shift.
Meteorologists have long recognised two types of cirrus cloud: “anvil” cirrus, which spread out from large storm systems, and “in-situ” cirrus, which seem to form on their own. Telling them apart is tricky, but by applying a new computer analysis to cloud satellite data, researchers spotted that in-situ cirrus emerged in response to major storm systems on the other side of the Earth.
Reporting in the American Geophysical Union Advances journal, they propose the storms generate massive atmospheric waves that travel across the equator, altering the temperature profile in the upper atmosphere and causing in-situ cirrus to emerge. Cirrus clouds are thought to allow sunlight through and trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in a net warming effect, so now we need to understand if future changes in storm patterns will change the distribution and amount of cirrus clouds.

7.	Country diary: A broken leg and singing crossbills – am I having a strange dream?
Inkpen, Berkshire: Drifting in and out of sleep on the woodland floor, I’m in searing pain, but far from alone
It was nobody’s fault, but here I am, lying on the damp floor of a wood, half a mile from the road. Drifting down with the falling leaves are the voices of two women, too easily accepting of blame. I reassure them and try to sit up, but the high singing in my ears turns to static, the edges of the wood begin to pixelate, and I lie down again before I faint.
Moments earlier, deep into Long Copse, Mum’s one-year-old labrador and my two-year-old collie crossbreed had met a young whippet. A case of the zoomies ensued, and as I turned to warn Mum, there was a sledgehammer blow to my lower leg as one, two or maybe all three dogs cannoned into me. Though I didn’t realise for two more days, my leg was broken before I hit the ground.
Because I think I’m tough as the old boots I have on, I keep trying to get up. But my body, with its low blood pressure trick, keeps putting me back down. I have some little sleeps, covered in a coat now, drifting, half-awake, wanting only the soft ground. I can smell pine and the sugar-beet mustiness of the sycamore leaves I’m lying on; their gold, mingled with butter‑yellow field maple, glows beyond my eyelids. I am remarkably at peace. Held. The voices of Mum and another kind woman from the village, who has brought a mug of sweet tea through the wood, are comforting.
A dragonfly lands on me at eye level, a smoked-glass common darter. Her cellophane wings crackle and my leg responds with searing pain. Beside me, a centipede rocks the rollercoaster of its amber body, back and forth over the curved veins of leaves. And then, high in the conifers, I hear a flock of pine-scented crossbills, chip chip chyop among trills. I could be dreaming, but I heard them here the week before. It feels wrong to point them out now, birdwatching while these three concerned women wait. I close my eyes, and keep their secret.
I refuse an ambulance, even though my husband is a paramedic, but it is he who comes in the end. So I hobble and hop the long trek back to the road, thoughts of red and green crossbills Christmassing in my head.

8.	Reuse and return schemes could help eliminate plastic pollution in 15 years, says report.
Pew Charitable Trusts finds plastic pollution will more than double globally by 2040 unless action taken
The 66m tonnes of pollution from plastic packaging that enters the global environment each year could be almost eliminated by 2040 primarily by reuse and return schemes, significant new research reveals.
In the most wide-ranging analysis of the global plastic system, the Pew Charitable Trusts, in collaboration with academics including at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, said plastic, a material once called revolutionary and modern, was now putting public health, world economies and the future of the planet at risk.
If nothing is done, plastic pollution will more than double in the next 15 years to 280m metric tonnes a year, the equivalent to a rubbish truck full of plastic waste being dumped every second. Much of the waste is made up of packaging.
This will damage every aspect of life; from the economy, to public health, to climate breakdown, the report, Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025, said.
“This rapid growth will harm human health and livelihoods through increased levels of land, water and air pollution, exposure to toxic chemicals, and risk of disease, and lead to higher rates of ingestion and entanglement among other species, resulting in more animals suffering illness, injury and death,” the authors said.
The production of plastic, which is made from fossil fuels, is expected to go up by 52% from 450m tonnes this year to 680m tonnes in 2040, twice as fast as the waste management systems across the world, which are already struggling to cope.
It is the packaging sector, an industry that creates items such as soft film, bags, bottles and rigid tubs for vegetables, margarines, drinks, fish and meat, that is causing plastic production increases. Packaging used more plastic than any other industry in 2025 and will continue to do so in 2040, the report found.
The single largest source of plastic waste across the world comes from packaging, which is used once then thrown away, and much of which is not recyclable. In 2025 it made up 33% globally of plastic waste, causing 66m tonnes of pollution to enter the environment each year.
But packaging pollution could be almost eliminated with concerted action such as deposit return schemes and reuse – where consumers take empty boxes or refillable cups to supermarkets and cafes. Combined with bans on certain polymers and substituting plastic for other materials, plastic pollution could be cut by 97% in the next 15 years, the research found.
“We have the ability to transform this, and nearly eliminate plastic pollution from packaging,” said Winnie Lau, project director, preventing plastic pollution, at the Pew Foundation.
“There are two key tools to decrease pollution from plastic packaging by 97% by 2040. The biggest of these are reuse and return systems, which will remove two-thirds of the pollution. The second is the reduction of plastic production for packaging and the use of other materials like cardboard, glass, metal and banning certain polymers.”
As well as polluting the environment, human contact with plastic – from children playing with toys, to people living next to petrochemical plants – is causing serious health problems.
“Plastic products contain more than 16,000 intentionally added chemicals as well as myriad unintentionally added contaminants,” the report said.
“Studies have already linked many of these chemicals to a range of health effects, such as hormone disruption, decreased fertility, low birth weights, cognitive and other developmental changes in children, diabetes and increases in cardiovascular and cancer risk factors.”
The global plastic system’s annual greenhouse gas emissions are also expected to rise from 2.7GtCO2e (gigatonne CO2 equivalent) in 2025 to 4.2 GtCO2e in 2040, an increase of 58%. If plastic production were a country, its emissions would be equivalent to the third-largest emitter by 2040, behind only China and the US.
But transformation is possible, the authors say. If interventions in waste management, production cuts, and reuse and return systems take place, plastic pollution could be reduced by 83%, greenhouse gas emissions by 38%, and health impacts by 54%. This would save governments globally $19bn (£14bn) each year in spending on plastic collection and disposal by 2040.
“Hope remains,” said Tom Dillon, of Pew Charitable Trusts. “The global community can remake the plastic system and solve the plastic pollution problem in a generation, but decision-makers will need to prioritise people and the planet.”

9.	National Trust launches fundraiser to help buy land around Cerne Giant
Deal expected to pave way for further scientific study, boost conservation and open up access to Dorset chalk figure
The mystery of when, how and – perhaps most importantly – why a giant naked figure was carved into a dizzyingly steep hillside in the English West Country has been a source of wonder and intrigue for centuries.
Future generations may come closer to solving the puzzle of the Cerne Giant after the National Trust stepped in to buy 340 acres of land around the 55-metre (180ft) figure.
The planned purchase is expected to clear the way for more archaeological investigations around Britain’s largest chalk hill figure, which looms over the rolling Dorset landscape.
It would also mean more work can be done to protect the flora and fauna on the hillside, including the rare Duke of Burgundy butterfly. And the conservation charity hopes the purchase will lead to better access for people to the figure, with more chances for exploration and play.
The trust has exchanged contacts for the land and it plans to use money from its funds, grants and bequests to cover £2.2m of the asking price.
On Wednesday it launched a fundraising appeal to try to raise another £300,000 for the purchase. It is encouraging people to donate by offering some the chance of joining the rechalking of the giant next year or receiving a “cheeky giant” pin badge with an imagined view of the figure from behind.
The trust said the acquisition would help conserve the giant’s setting in perpetuity.
Steve Timms, an archaeologist, said: “The acquisition will provide an opportunity for archaeological research and investigation on a landscape scale. This will not only help us manage the land in the most appropriate way but also answer questions about the development of settlement and ritual activity over the area over several millennia.”
Many theories have surrounded the giant’s identity and origins, including it possibly being an ancient symbol of spirituality, the likeness of Hercules or a mockery of Oliver Cromwell.
In 2021, National Trust archaeologists concluded that the giant was probably constructed in the late Saxon period.
Near to the giant lie other nationally important monuments including the Trendle – earthworks whose date and purpose are unknown – and a bronze age burial mound.
The giant itself was given to the National Trust in 1920 but there were concerns earlier this year when land around the figure was put on the market. People who lived nearby and rights of way campaigners expressed concern that the spot could be developed or access to the hillside lost.
Hannah Jefferson, the general manager for West Dorset and Cranborne Chase, said: “The land is extraordinary. By protecting the area around the giant, we can restore a fully functioning ecosystem that supports species under threat and allows wildlife to thrive. There’s also potential for new walking and play opportunities, creativity and interpretation.”
The trust plans to join up parcels of land around the giant to create more of the conditions needed for the Duke of Burgundy butterfly and other flora and fauna to survive. The hillside is also an important habitat for orchids and hazel glove fungus, which is typically found only in temperate rainforests farther west.
Michael Clarke, an area ranger, said: “If we’re serious about tackling climate change and helping wildlife adapt, we need landscapes that are bigger, better connected and more resilient. The Duke of Burgundy butterfly is a perfect example. It has very specific needs, thriving only in taller, moister grass and laying its eggs on certain plants.
“Its breeding conditions are so exacting that attempts can easily fail. That’s why it’s essential to give this butterfly space to expand into healthy, connected areas, reducing the risk of inbreeding and giving it a fighting chance to survive.”
The actor, broadcaster and comedian Stephen Fry has backed the appeal, as has the Countryfile presenter Sean Fletcher, who said: “When you stand on Giant Hill and look out across this landscape, you feel the weight of history and the wonder of nature all at once.”

10.	People living along polluted Thames file legal complaint to force water firm to act
Residents claim raw sewage and poorly treated effluent as result of Thames Water’s failings are threat to health
Communities across south-east England are filing the first coordinated legal complaints that sewage pollution by Thames Water negatively affects their lives.
Thames Water failed to complete upgrades to 98 treatment plants and pumping stations which have the worst records for sewage pollution into the environment, despite a promise to invest in them over the last five years.
People in 13 areas including Hackney, Oxford, Richmond upon Thames and Wokingham are sending statutory nuisance complaints to their local authorities demanding accountability from Thames Water and urgent action.
At several sites it is not just raw sewage from storm overflows that causes pollution but also the quality of treated effluent coming from Thames Water facilities, which presents a direct threat to public health, the campaigners say.
At Thames’s Newbury sewage treatment plant, raw effluent discharges into the River Kennet, a protected chalk stream. Data shows raw sewage discharges from the plant increased by 240% between 2019 and 2024 from 482 hours to 1,630 hours. Thames says the plant is among its 26 most polluting sites.
Thames wants the water regulator, Ofwat, to allow it to charge customers £1.18bn over the next five years for the upgrades it has failed to carry out. But the regulator has refused to let it pass the full cost on to customers, allowing only £793m, as it deems bill payers have already funded the upgrades. It says any escalation of costs should be borne by Thames Water.
With the company failing to act, people living in the catchment are turning to statutory nuisance complaints under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In letters to their local authorities, they are asking for decisive action by Thames to stop its sewage pollution that is causing harm along the river.
A statutory nuisance is an activity that unreasonably interferes with the use or enjoyment of land and is likely to cause prejudice or injury to health.
Those living in the area say sewage pollution from Thames’s failing sites and infrastructure has made rivers unsafe and disrupted recreation, sport, local businesses and everyday enjoyment.
They cite a 16-year-old rower from Henley rowing club who became unwell after training on the river; tests confirmed he had contracted E coli. His illness coincided with his GCSE exams, preventing him from revising and sitting some papers.
In West Berkshire, people are highlighting the case of a kayaker who capsized and became unwell over the following days. And at Tagg’s Island in Hampton, south-west London, five children became ill after playing in the River Thames near Hurst Park.
Laura Reineke, who lives in Henley-on-Thames and founded the campaign group Friends of the Thames, said: “People here are fed up with living beside a river that’s being treated like an open sewer. We’ve submitted a nuisance complaint to our local authority because what Thames Water is doing is unacceptable.”
Citizen testing of the river has found treated effluent leaving the Henley plant has contained E coli at levels 30 times higher than bathing water safe levels, calculated using Thames Water’s data released under an environmental information request.
“Local residents are angry and determined to hold this company accountable for the damage it’s causing to our river and our community,” Reineke said.
Thames has already received a record £104m fine by Ofwat over environmental breaches involving sewage spills across its network, after failing to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively.
Amy Fairman, the head of campaigns at River Action, which is supporting the coordinated complaints, said: “This action is about fixing sewage pollution in the Thames for good, not compensating people for past failings.
“Each local authority must investigate these complaints and, where statutory nuisance is found to exist, issue an abatement notice and take enforcement action. Councils now have a legal duty to act.”
She said there was extensive evidence of performance failures at Thames Water, which was on the brink of insolvency. Despite this ministers had not put the company into special administration, a process that would allow for urgent infrastructure upgrades, put public interest ownership and governance first, and protect communities and the environment.
A Thames Water spokesperson said they are working on a big upgrade to their network and aiming to invest £9.5 billion (in 2022/23 prices) across their wastewater assets over the next five years.
“We informed Ofwat, the Environment Agency and other industry stakeholders in August 2023 that some Water Industry National Environmental Programme (WINEP) schemes would not be delivered on time. Despite spending all of the allowance in AMP7, we have been open about the challenges of delivering all the elements of the WINEP7 programme, which was impacted by cost increases that were higher than the inflation index applied to our allowances.” They added that farming, industry, road runoff, wildlife, and increasingly extreme weather also play a role in river health.

‘Soil is more important than oil’: inside the perennial grain revolution.

On the concrete floor of a greenhouse in rural Kansas stands a neat grid of 100 plastic plant pots, each holding a straggly crown of strappy, grass-like leaves. These plants are perennials – they keep growing, year after year. That single characteristic separates them from soya beans, wheat, maize, rice and every other major grain crop, all of which are annuals: plants that live and die within a single growing season.

“These plants are the winners, the ones that get to pass their genes on [to future generations],” says Lee DeHaan of the Land Institute, an agricultural non-profit based in Salina, Kansas. If DeHaan’s breeding programme maintains its current progress, the descendant of these young perennial crop plants could one day usher in a wholesale revolution in agriculture.

The plants are intermediate wheatgrass. Since 2010, DeHaan has been transforming this small-seeded, wild species into a high-yielding, domesticated grain crop called Kernza. He believes it will eventually be a viable – and far more sustainable – alternative to annual wheat, the world’s most widely grown crop and the source of one in five of all calories consumed by humanity.

Annual plants thrive in bare ground. Growing them requires fields to be prepared, usually by ploughing or intensive herbicide treatment, and new seeds planted each year. For this reason, Tim Crews, chief scientist at the Land Institute, describes existing agricultural systems as “the greatest disturbance on the planet”. “There’s nothing like it,” he says.

The damage inflicted by today’s food system is clear: one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions; ocean dead zones covering thousands of square miles; and 25bn-40bn tonnes of fertile topsoil lost each year.

Replacing annual plants with perennial varieties would massively reduce agriculture’s environmental impact. Soil erosion would drop; perennials would instead build soil health, limiting runoff of nutrients and toxic farm chemicals, cutting fertiliser and pesticide use, and storing climate-heating carbon within farm soils.

There is just one problem. Reliable, high-yielding perennial grain crops barely exist.

The inspiration for the Land Institute’s push to develop perennial grains came from its founder, Wes Jackson, 89. For Jackson, the health of soils that generate 95% of human calories should be a primary concern for all civilisations. “Soil is more important than oil,” he says in a recent documentary. “Soil is as much of a non-renewable resource as oil. Start there, and ask: ‘What does that require of us?’”

Start there, and ask: ‘What does that require of us?’”Jackson hit upon an answer during a visit to a native prairie reserve in Kansas in the late 1970s. Prairies are highly productive and biodiverse perennial grassland ecosystems. They don’t erode soils; they build them. Indeed, the rich soils that make much of the US midwest and Great Plains such prime agricultural lands were formed, over thousands of years, by prairie plants working with underground microbes.

Why is it that we cannot have perennial grains that grow like prairie plants, Jackson wondered. “That was the epiphany that set me off,” he said in a recent interview.

DeHaan, 52, learned about Jackson’s mission while he was a teenager in the early 1990s. Having grown up on a Minnesota farm, he was immediately inspired. “I would love to try to create the first perennial grain crop,” he resolved. “That became my dream.”

Though still under development, Kernza is already a viable crop, grown at modest scale in 15 US states. Kernza seeds and flour are used in a range of products, from beers to breakfast cereals.
The key challenge is yields. In Kansas, the best Kernza yields are about one-quarter those of annual wheat. But DeHaan says this is changing rapidly. “My best current extrapolation is that some Kernza plants could have wheat-like yields within about 15 years.”

“We have to go fast,” he says. To hit this target, his breeding scheme deploys DNA profiling, computer modelling and far-red LED lighting to push the experimental plants through two full breeding cycles each year.

But yields are just one metric of success. Whereas annual wheat roots are about half a metre long and temporary, Kernza’s roots are permanent and can plunge 3 metres deep. Such roots unlock a whole suite of environmental and agricultural benefits: stabilising and enriching soils, gathering nutrients and providing water, even during droughts.

EA to spend millions clearing Oxfordshire illegal waste mountain in break with policy.

The Environment Agency is to spend millions of pounds to clear an enormous illegal rubbish dump in Oxfordshire, saying the waste is at risk of catching fire.

But the decision announced on Thursday to clear up the thousands of tonnes of waste illegally dumped outside Kidlington has drawn an angry response from a Labour MP in Greater Manchester whose constituents have been living alongside 25,000 tonnes of toxic rubbish for nearly a year.

In Bickershaw, Wigan, criminals dumped the waste in a residential street adjacent to a primary school. During the summer heatwave the rubbish caught fire and burned for nine days, forcing the school to close and residents to stay indoors.

Josh Simons, the MP for Makerfield, said: “This decision throws mud in the face of my working-class constituents in Bickershaw, Wigan, but also of people across the country suffering from toxic, illegal dumps that don’t have the privilege of living in middle class Oxfordshire. I am so angry about it.”

“My constituents will feel this is unfair, unjust, and once again like a public body is ignoring working-class communities in the north.”

The EA’s policy is to refuse to clear up illegal waste dumps across the country, instead pursuing the perpetrators and landowners. But officials said on Thursday they had taken the exceptional decision to clear up the waste outside Kidlington, which is next to the River Cherwell, because the scale of the fire risk set it apart from other illegal waste dumps in England and presented an overriding public imperative.

The agency has been given no extra money to clear the waste, the cost of which is likely to run into several millions of pounds. The EA said this would come from “making efficiencies in its operations”. The cost to the taxpayer will also include the payment of the landfill tax on the waste to the Treasury.

Simons said. “What is not ‘exceptional’ about a toxic waste dump on fire right next to a primary school and bunch of local businesses? Could it be because the kids and businesses are not in Oxfordshire? I will fight tooth and nail for the Environment Agency to treat my towns equally and clear the Bickershaw site – and treat us like the good people of Oxfordshire.”

This week ministers rejected all recommendations of an inquiry into waste crime by the House of Lords environment and climate change committee.

Lords highlighted how organised criminals were making millions every year from illegally dumping rubbish. Peers called for the government to carry out a “root and branch review” of responses to waste crime. The report said 38m tonnes of waste – enough to fill Wembley Stadium 35 times – was being illegally dumped every year, mainly by established organised crime groups often with links to other criminal activity such as money laundering and modern slavery.

But the environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, rejected the call for a review and all other suggestions in the report. She said the government would be announcing policies in the New Year that would drive criminality away from the waste sector, informed by previous reviews, investigations and intelligence.

The dumping in Kidlington took place under the noses of the EA, which was monitoring the site after being alerted to suspicious activity. Similarly in Wigan, Simons alerted the EA in January to dumping taking place on Bolton House Road, and was told it would monitor the site. Over the course of several months, lorryloads of waste were dumped in the residential street. Part of the illegal waste has been tipped into a field where the primary school children played sport.

The EA said: “In both Kidlington and Wigan, we are laser-focused on finding the offenders and bringing them to justice.”

Hightailing along city streets and raiding ponds: otters’ revival in Britain

Unlike the fox, the otter has been a rare visitor in towns and cities across the UK. But after decades of intense conservation work, that is changing. In the past year alone, the aquatic mammal has been spotted on a river-boat dock in London’s Canary Wharf, dragging an enormous fish along a riverbank in Stratford-upon-Avon, and plundering garden ponds near York. One otter was even filmed causing chaos in a Shetland family’s kitchen in March.

Janice Bradley, head of nature recovery for the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, says: “Twenty years ago, they were almost nonexistent. Then we saw them coming up the River Trent from other areas. Now, we’ve got records of otters in virtually every river and watercourse in the county. It’s remarkable.”
Nobody knows how many otters there are in the UK, although it is widely agreed that the population has increased, after nearly being wiped out in the polluted waterways of mid-20th century Britain. Some naturalists estimate there are 11,000 nationwide, but acknowledge that it is guesswork.

In the 1970s, surveyors searched nearly 3,000 sites across the UK, but found the animals at just 6% of them, mainly in strongholds in Scotland, Wales, Norfolk and south-west England. Now, they are widespread, using their sensitive whiskers and webbed feet to hunt in waters across the country.

Their return is a fragile tale of improving water quality, say conservationists. The dumping of industrial waste from factories and toxic pesticides ravaged fish populations in British rivers in the 19th and 20th centuries, with disastrous consequences for otters, which ended up consuming a lot of the toxins.
Bans on harmful pollutants, improving water quality – notwithstanding more recent problems with water utilities’ dumping of raw sewage – and a targeted reintroduction campaign in the east of the country have all helped their return.

Jon Trail, of the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, says: “I think the surveys in the 70s were a lightbulb moment for people, when they realised otters had been seen historically and they couldn’t see them any more.
“There are old documents detailing encounters between otters and naturalists, yet people had not seen them for years.

“It has been a slow burn. Otters typically have one, two, sometimes three youngsters that the female looks after for a year, so it’s a slow recolonisation rate. Over 10 years, you might just have five or six kits, so it was always going to take a bit of time. But now it has passed a tipping point.”

Not everyone is happy about the return of the otter in the UK. Anglers blame them for devouring fish at their favourite spots, accusing the animals of disrupting the balance of the river, but many experts say this claim is overblown.

Despite their traditional portrayal as only preying on fish, otters eat a diverse range of rodents, birds and amphibians, and analysis of their diet shows they rarely go for the large fish prized by the angling community.“In British rivers, fish stocks are limited in some places. That’s not because the otters have recovered,” she says.

The Otter Project’s findings paint a complicated picture of the recovery, showing that heavy metals, Pfas “forever chemicals”, and pesticides are still building up in the mammals. But amid growing concern about the health of the UK’s rivers, Chadwick says the otter could become a symbol of the change that many are demanding.

“Otters are a really good way of monitoring the health of our waterways. A lot of chemical pollutions build up in an animal over time. They are often at trace levels in water so we cannot detect them in samples. But if you test the top of the food chain, they become detectable,” says Chadwick.

“If we can use otters as a sort of charismatic ambassador for river health, that can be really quite a powerful thing.”

Weather tracker: Australia bushfires could be most dangerous since ‘black summer’.
Bushfires have been ravaging Australia, with more than 50 burning throughout New South Wales, destroying homes and causing at least one death. Nine blazes remained out of control on Monday as flames ripped through homes and critical infrastructure. Scorching temperatures – peaking at 41C in Koolewong – combined with fierce, erratic winds to spread the fires rapidly and made them harder to control.

On Sunday night an Australian firefighter was killed after a tree fell on him while he worked on a fire near Bulahdelah, about 150 miles (250km) north of Sydney. The blaze scorched 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres) and destroyed four homes over the weekend. NSW, one of Australia’s most fire-prone regions, is particularly vulnerable because of its hot, dry climate and vast eucalyptus forests, which shed oils that become highly flammable.

Farther south, Tasmania faced its own emergency, with a fast-moving 700-hectare fire at Dolphin Sands destroying 19 homes and damaging at least 40 more, leaving coastal communities reeling.

Authorities warn the heightened bushfire threat is being fuelled by rising temperatures and a dangerous build-up of vegetation. Previous years of La Niña weather systems had unusually wet summers, resulting in dense growth across forests and grasslands. However, recent months of below-average rainfall have rapidly dried that vegetation, turning it into abundant, volatile fuel. With the season already labelled as “high risk”, many fear this could be Australia’s most dangerous summer since the “black summer” fires of 2019-20.

Meanwhile, the US state of Washington is bracing for dangerous flooding as an atmospheric river continues to drench the Pacific north-west. Authorities issued immediate evacuation orders for about 100,000 residents on Thursday as relentless rain pummelled the region for another day.

In just 24 hours, north-west Washington has been hit with 120-205mm of rainfall, with flooding from the Cascade Foothills to Puget Sound expected to worsen through Friday. Rivers across the state are surging towards their most severe flood classifications, with several threatening to break historic records. The Skagit River, one of Washington’s largest, is forecast to crest 6ft above its previous peak.

Elsewhere in the US, hurricane-force winds topping 80mph left thousands without power in Alaska’s Matanuska-Susitna borough over the weekend, closing schools and businesses and damaging homes. The strong gusts were caused by a clash of weather systems; a cold, dense high-pressure mass over the Copper River basin collided with a warmer low-pressure system moving in from the Gulf of Alaska. The contrast created a siphon-like effect, funnelling frigid air down the mountain valleys and driving it into what is known as a katabatic wind.

As the UK looks to invest in nuclear, here’s what it could mean for Britain’s environment.


When UK prime minister Keir Starmer announced last week that he was “implementing the Fingleton review”, you can forgive the pulse of most Britons for failing to quicken.

But behind the uninspiring statement lies potentially the biggest deregulation for decades, posing peril for endangered species, if wildlife experts are to be believed, and a likely huge row with the EU.

More, after this week’s most important reads.
Earlier this year, John Fingleton, a lively, intelligent Irish economist, was commissioned by the government to lead a “taskforce” with a mission to come up with a way to build nuclear power faster and cheaper. It’s accepted by experts that we need more nuclear if we are to meet net zero, and that Britain is the most expensive place in the world to build it. In the end, Fingleton turned in a review with 47 recommendations aimed at speeding up the process. So far, so snoozeworthy.

However, his recommendations, if adopted, could well lead to the biggest divergence from retained EU habitat and environment law since Brexit. Changes could be made to the habitats directive, which Britain helped write when we were in the EU, and which protect rare species and the places they live. The government could also make it more costly for individuals and charities to take judicial reviews against infrastructure projects.

Fingleton thinks his review should also be applied to railways, reservoirs and other infrastructure to make it easier to build – which means there would be intense, widespread deregulation. So does Starmer, who said in his speech about the document that there are “well-intentioned, but fundamentally misguided, environmental regulations” and the review should be implemented “right across our economy”.

Legal advice is that removing these rules for nuclear power will inevitably lead for other infrastructure projects to be subject to the same, weaker regulatory system. Expert planning lawyer Alexa Culver said: “It’s a clever move to sneak broadbrush environmental deregulation, as the government can point to ‘net zero’ as being the ultimate driver. In reality, though, if you don’t protect ecosystems while reducing emissions, you’ve lost the battle. We’re gone anyway.”

It’s not surprising Starmer is clinging to anything which might increase economic growth – he and the Labour party were elected on a promise to make Britain’s economy boom so taxes don’t have to rise and public services can be properly funded. Instead, taxes are being ratcheted to the highest post-war level and the OBR has predicted an anticipated average GDP growth of 1.5% over the next five years. This is despite the controversial Planning and Infrastructure Bill which Starmer introduced in order to “get Britain building” and experts say it will weaken environmental protections.
Nature also continues to decline. The recently released biodiversity indicators show species numbers continue to decrease in the UK, which is extremely concerning when you consider just how much wildlife has dropped off since the 1970s. Some species, including one-fifth of mammals, are facing extinction, and recent figures show wild bird numbers are in freefall.

Of the review, Georgia Dent, CEO of Somerset Wildlife Trust said: “The government seems to have adopted a simple, reductive narrative that nature regulations are blocking development, and this is simply wrong. Nature in the UK is now in steep decline and the government has legally binding targets for nature’s recovery, and is failing massively in this at the moment. To reduce the hard-won protections that are allowing small, vulnerable populations of species to cling on for dear life is absolutely the wrong direction to take.”

And many economists agree that one of the biggest hits to GDP growth in recent years has been Brexit, which has caused much trade friction between the UK and our closest neighbours. Some estimates say leaving the EU has reduced growth by 8%. In that sense, it’s sensible that Starmer has tried to start a “reset” with the EU to reduce barriers to trade. But ripping up parts of the habitats directive and other EU-derived conventions could put this at risk, particularly as the UK is negotiating an energy deal with the EU. There are competition and non-regression clauses in the newest free trade agreement, which prevent either side from weakening environmental law. Government sources tell me their legal advice has been that implementing the Fingleton review could put the free trade agreement at risk.

This isn’t all to say change isn’t required. Even within the EU’s strict environmental framework, we have seen nature decline and economic growth slow. And Fingleton himself isn’t some red tape slashing snail-hater; I spoke to him this week and he genuinely cares about the environment. He told me he was one of the “first no-dig gardeners”, that he loves nature, and thinks these reforms could simplify the process while providing vast sums for nature’s recovery.

He’s also from Ireland, a European country, and wants the EU to succeed in building infrastructure, meeting net zero and boosting economic growth, so believes the EU should follow his approach.

Perhaps his ideas will work, but they are being adopted, so far, with little debate or discussion, as well as minimal to no ecological input. When MPs, environmental experts and the EU look past the boring title and read the detail, Starmer may have a fight on his hands.

Changes to polar bear DNA could help them adapt to global heating, study finds.

Changes in polar bear DNA that could help the animals adapt to warmer climates have been detected by researchers, in a study thought to be the first time a statistically significant link has been found between rising temperatures and changing DNA in a wild mammal species.

Climate breakdown is threatening the survival of polar bears. Two-thirds of them are expected to have disappeared by 2050 as their icy habitat melts and the weather becomes hotter.

Now scientists at the University of East Anglia have found that some genes related to heat stress, ageing and metabolism are behaving differently in polar bears living in south-east Greenland, suggesting they may be adjusting to warmer conditions.

The researchers analysed blood samples taken from polar bears in two regions of Greenland and compared “jumping genes”: small, mobile pieces of the genome that can influence how other genes work. Scientists looked at the genes in relation to temperatures in the two regions and at the associated changes in gene expression.

“DNA is the instruction book inside every cell, guiding how an organism grows and develops,” said the lead researcher, Dr Alice Godden. “By comparing these bears’ active genes to local climate data, we found that rising temperatures appear to be driving a dramatic increase in the activity of jumping genes within the south-east Greenland bears’ DNA.”

As local climates and diets evolve as a result of changes in habitat and prey forced by global heating, the genetics of the bears appear to be adapting, with the group of bears in the warmest part of the country showing more changes than the communities farther north. The authors of the study have said these changes could help us understand how polar bears might survive in a warming world, inform understanding of which populations are most at risk and guide future conservation efforts.

This is because the findings, published on Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, suggest the genes that are changing play a crucial role in how different polar bear populations are evolving.

Godden said: “This finding is important because it shows, for the first time, that a unique group of polar bears in the warmest part of Greenland are using ‘jumping genes’ to rapidly rewrite their own DNA, which might be a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.”

Temperatures in north-east Greenland are colder and less variable, while in the south-east there is a much warmer and less icy environment, with steep temperature fluctuations.

DNA sequences in animals change over time, but this process can be accelerated by environmental stress such as a rapidly heating climate.

There were some interesting DNA changes, such as in areas linked to fat processing, that could help polar bears survive when food is scarce. Bears in warmer regions had more rough, plant-based diets compared with the fatty, seal-based diets of northern bears, and the DNA of south-eastern bears seemed to be adapting to this.

Godden said: “We identified several genetic hotspots where these jumping genes were highly active, with some located in the protein-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that the bears are undergoing rapid, fundamental genetic changes as they adapt to their disappearing sea ice habitat.”

The next step will be to look at other polar bear populations, of which there are 20 around the world, to see if similar changes are happening to their DNA.

This research could help protect the bears from extinction. But the scientists said it was crucial to stop temperature rises accelerating by reducing the burning of fossil fuels.

Godden said: “We cannot be complacent, this offers some hope but does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction. We still need to be doing everything we can to reduce global carbon emissions and slow temperature increases.”

Economic growth no longer linked to carbon emissions in most of the world, study finds.

The once-rigid link between economic growth and carbon emissions is breaking across the vast majority of the world, according to a study released ahead of Friday’s 10th anniversary of the Paris climate agreement.

The analysis, which underscores the effectiveness of strong government climate policies, shows this “decoupling” trend has accelerated since 2015 and is becoming particularly pronounced among major emitters in the global south.

Countries representing 92% of the global economy have now decoupled consumption-based carbon emissions and GDP expansion, according to the report by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).

Using the latest Global Carbon Budget data, it finds that decoupling is now the norm across advanced economies, with 46% of global GDP in countries that have expanded their economies while cutting emissions, including Brazil, Colombia and Egypt. The most pronounced decouplings occurred in the UK, Norway and Switzerland.

More important is the spectacular shift in China. The world’s biggest emitter is sharply reducing its economic dependence on coal and other fossil fuels. Between 2015 and 2023, China’s consumption-based emissions rose 24%, less than half the growth of its economy (more than 50%). For the past 18 months, its emissions have plateaued and many analysts believe they may have peaked. If China can turn the corner, the rest of the world should follow.

In total, 21 countries have improved in the past decade. Among them are Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Colombia, Egypt, Italy, Mexico and South Africa – all of which were able to grow economically while reducing emissions.

Twenty-two others have consistently managed to achieve decoupling in the decades before and after 2015. Among them are the US, Japan, Canada and most countries in the European Union.

Donald Trump has tried to move the US in the opposite direction, but his first term as president caused only a brief uptick in emissions. For most of the past two decades US emissions have been falling, according to the authors of the report.

New Zealand, Latvia, Slovenia, Lithuania, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Togo and the host of Cop29, Azerbaijan, had all decoupled before 2015, but their growth has since again become dependent on fossil fuels.

The report underlines how international talks, such as the United Nations Cop gatherings, have helped to drive an energy transition, even if progress has so far failed to keep pace with the threat posed by human-caused global heating.

An earlier analysis, by the ECIU shows that the growth of annual CO2 emissions has slowed to 1.2% since 2015, compared with 18.4% in the decade before the Paris agreement.

That agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, included a commitment to limit heating to well below 2C above preindustrial levels. That sent a strong signal to businesses and governments that they needed to find alternatives to the oil, gas and coal responsible for climate disruption.

As a result, the projection for end-of-century global heating has fallen from 4C to 2.6C. Despite this progress, the authors say more rapid action is needed in the coming decade to stabilise the climate.

With emissions slowing, many analysts hope the peak could finally be in sight, which would usher in the fall that is essential if the world is to keep global heating to between 1.5C and 2C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century.

John Lang, the author of the ECIU report, said: “I’m definitely encouraged. Looking back shows how much progress we have made over the past 10 years. The world is now in a pre-conditioning stage ahead of structural decline. We are approaching a historic point when emissions start to go down. That is super exciting.”

Deathly silent’: two out of three corals in world heritage-listed Ningaloo reef have been killed, scientists confirm.

Almost two out of three corals across popular tourism spots at the world heritage-listed Ningaloo reef died after an unprecedented marine heatwave hit the Western Australia region, scientists have said.

The areas in Ningaloo’s northern lagoon had undergone a “profound ecological simplification” with coral species that were keystones to the habitat among those killed.

The marine heatwave swept across the Western Australian coastline last summer and autumn, turning corals white from heat stress from Ningaloo to Ashmore reef 1,500km to the north-east.

When corals sit in unusually warm water for too long they separate from the algae that give them much of their colour and nutrients, leaving behind a translucent flesh revealing the white skeleton behind.

About 90% of the extra heat on the planet has been taken up by the ocean. The heating is caused when greenhouse gases are released from burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests.

Coral scientist Zoe Richards, an associate professor at Curtin University, had in March surveyed 1,600 individual corals at eight sites spanning 40km when the bleaching event was peaking.

“The bleaching was so confronting because it was so expansive,” she said.

Other scientists who visited Ningaloo during the mass coral bleaching spoke of their shock at the extent of the heat and the suffering of the corals.

When Richards, who carried out the work in partnership with the Minderoo Exmouth Research Laboratory, returned with Curtin University researcher David Juszkiewicz at the end of October, about 1,000 of the 1,600 corals she had recorded had died.

She said: “You go in hoping the corals you saw that were partially bleached might have recovered. Unfortunately the scale tipped to mortality. Most of the data is showing that any coral that bleached in March went on to die.”

‘Incredible places’
The areas surveyed were between the Osprey and Tantabiddi sanctuary zones and cover the northern parts of the Ningaloo lagoon that are popular with tourists, Richards said.

“They’re incredible places where you can swim right off the beach and see all this luxurious coral,” she said.

Diving and snorkelling on these reefs, Richards said, was usually accompanied with “lots of popping and cracking” sounds of fish and other animals.

“It was deathly silent,” she said. “The only animals that looked happy were the sea cucumbers. They are the detritus-eaters.”
Fourth mass bleaching
The loss of corals at Ningaloo was part of the fourth and worst global mass bleaching event on record that exposed more than 80% of reefs in more than 80 countries to temperatures high enough to cause bleaching.

Some scientists have claimed global heating has already pushed tropical coral reefs to a tipping point of long-term decline.

“Corals act like thermometers for the ocean,” Richards said.

“When they bleach, they are sending out a clear signal that the temperature is too high. They don’t talk, but they are signalling to us very clearly. We’re on the brink of catastrophic ecosystem decline. This happening everywhere.

“It’s just really depressing. I have devoted my whole life to coral research. I am starting to visualise the point where all we have left of corals and reefs is memories.”
